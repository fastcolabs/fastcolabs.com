<p><a href="http://www.francisbitonti.com/" target="_blank">Francis Bitoni</a>, the mind behind Dita Von Teese’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Dita+Von+Teese%E2%80%99s+curve-hugging+3D+printed+dress&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=USLgUoqgF-njsATt84DwBA&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=2323&amp;bih=1162" target="_blank">curve-hugging 3-D-printed dress</a>, recently teamed up with Lagoa and MakerBot to host a 10-day workshop on the emerging field of 3-D garment design. Designers from every industry gathered at the <a href="http://metropolitanexchange.org/" target="_blank">Metropolitan Exchange</a> to collaborate with Francis on his next creation.</p>

<p>Computational design is the newest trend slowly penetrating the fashion industry and high-powered rendering engines and MakerBots are the new pins and needles of couture. Learning it means learning a new set of four tools:</p>

</ol>
Along with this new set of tools comes a vocabulary that sounds as though it’s been “extruded” from a Neal Stephenson novel. Luckily, we’re here to get you acquainted with computational design lingo and have you 3-D printing in no time with our main takeaways from the workshop. Here's our crash course.

<p><strong>Maya</strong> is used for generating designs from polygons. A polygon mesh is a 3-D image comprised of vertices, edges, and faces. The faces are generally made up of triangles, quadrilaterals, or other simple convex polygons which result in a delicate tessellation. A polygon mesh can only generate curvature with a series of vertices.</p>

<p>As seen above, we were able to design dresses to be printed in Maya. Creating curves with polygons requires a different approach to design than when sketching by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Rhino</strong> (below) is for generating designs from NURBS. Nurbs (also known as Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) allow for a designer to draw curvature and surfaces accurately by creating 2-D lines, circles, arcs, or curves mathematically. This makes for generous flexibility in generating a printable model as the geometry can be altered precisely.</p>

<p><strong>Processing</strong> is for programming for mathematical visualizations</p>

<p>Programming languages that include a physics engine allow simulations of physical systems. The most recognizable application being video games, physics engines can also be used for data visualizations and for real-time simulations of all sorts. Visualizations rendered in processing make beautiful inspirations for products created through algorithmic design.</p>

<p>Using Processing, we can simulate a Maya-rendered object both repelling and attracting vector lines. This technique builds a firm foundation for computational design.</p>

<p><strong>Lagoa</strong> is for browser-based rendering. Rendering can be thought of simply as artistic rendering, like a painter conveying abstraction or hyper-realism to an established scene. This is done by generating an image from models in a “scene” file, which can be altered with geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading to create a virtual scene. This data can be processed then output into an impressive presentation.</p>

<p>Computational design requires a language and skillset that belonged solely to animators and architects before it found its ways into fashion.

<p>So, to polygon, or to nurb? The answer is both. See our interview with Frances Bitoni below.</p>
