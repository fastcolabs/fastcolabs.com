<p>WebOS is getting a new lease on life, and this time it looks pretty awesome. The OS is about to get a second wind in a new line of Smart TVs from LG, and one wonders how well a platform designed for mobile devices will work in the living room. Smart TVs, after all, have historically <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/10/smart-tv-is-dumb-why-there-wont-be-a-smart-tv-ecosystem/" target="_blank">been terrible</a>. But this one looks, well, damn near user friendly--even if it's a little overzealous on the sound effects.</p>

<p>WebOS, however, might be the perfect solution. Today LG released a promotional video showing their Smart TVs in action, and it looks pretty spectacular. We’ve already written about the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024424/lg-wanted-webos-for-its-tvs-because-of-these-three-features" target="_self">company’s goals for the platform</a>--simplification, in a word. LG wanted an OS that laid all its features out for users, and was easy enough for anyone in the home to use. A nice notion on paper, but did LG pull it off?</p>

<p>The platform, initially developed for smartphones and tablets by Palm and HP, was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5264580/the-lost-secrets-of-webos" target="_blank">inexplicably discontinued two years ago</a>. While there’s no way of knowing for sure until the new sets are available for purchase, the company definitely seems to be on track. The OS appears to be well-designed, responsive, and intuitive. If it works as smoothly as advertised, Smart TVs may finally be coming of age.</p>
