<p><p class="interview-question">What are you really looking for in an app?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">The judges are looking for a well-executed app that does something interesting with the retail experience and a mobile device. You can read one judge's <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008674/accelerator/name-it-frame-it-prove-it-win-it-notes-judging-battleground" target="_self">detailed advice here</a>. Whether it is for mobile buying or in-store is up to you. Solve the problem you think is most interesting.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Is this going to be used in place of Target's current app?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">No. This is an additional app, meant to do something new and different.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Is it required to have the catalog of the products, checkout, payment?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">No. Your app can focus on whatever tasks you think improve the retail experience—not just buying.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Are we limited to using what is available in your API, or we can have other data sources?<br />
</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">You can mashup any data or APIs you like into your project.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">I would prefer to win second prize and keep my IP. If I win the top prize, can I turn it down?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">Yes, you may choose to remain a finalist at the end of the contest.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Can our team enter on behalf of our company?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">Yes, but if the company wins, it gets awarded the money and it can distribute it however it pleases.<br />
</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Do I have to wait until entries close to start building my project?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">Of course not! You can start writing code as soon as you like. We only ask for a plan at entry.</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-question">Can you take international entries?</p></p>

<p><p class="interview-answer">Anyone with a current resident visa is a “legal resident.” So, not tourists, but certainly H-1B, students, et al.</p></p>
