<p>Kickstarter generated $480 million in pledges in 2013, but that doesn't mean your project is guaranteed a piece of the cash flow.</p>

<p>Georgia Institute of Technology researchers studied hundreds of thousands of Kickstarters for hints of what made successful projects. They focused on the copy-writing inside the projects. Using data-mining software, researchers studied 45,000 Kickstarter projects and analyzed 9 million phrases, according to <em><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24868-the-right-words-to-boost-your-kickstarter-pitch.html?cmpid=RSS%7CNSNS%7C2012-GLOBAL%7Conline-news#.UtbDyvaeFwB" target="_blank">New Scientist</a></em>. What they found: Language that evoked gift-giving was a big donation-getter, just like the word "green," as in "sustainable." Turnoffs: a lack of confidence.</p>

<p>Researcher Tanushree Mitra says Kickstarter phrases that offer a strong "reciprocity" led to successful funding. Offering a gift to backers generated the most funding, regardless of the value of the gift. Consider the price jump for backer incentives. You could be missing out on a lot of collective dollars from middle-ground backers by jumping from $50 to $100.</p>

<p>Mitra also says confidence is key. Researchers found that even the slightest hint of desperation is backer repellent. Don’t use these three words: "even a dollar." Researchers found that phrases "even a dollar short” and “even a dollar can" resulted in a failed project. They team said it reads as “groveling” for money, which is a big turnoff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geisel-software.com/content/kickstarter-killers-4-mistakes-will-completely-sink-your-project" target="_blank">Critics also say</a> there's a big missed opportunity in the word "green." Failing to acknowledge or include a sustainable feature could be a game changer. Any chance to get the word "green" in there will score extra points with Kickstarter’s eco-friendly crowd.</p>

<p>The researchers studied Pebble Smartwatch's wildly successful Kickstarter campaign against failed campaigns. Pebble made history last April when it became the most backed project on Kickstarter to date. Originally seeking $100,000, the company received more than $10 million--$2.6 million of which came in the last few days. (Statistically, technology and gaming projects have the highest amount of successfully funded campaigns in the $20,000 to $1 million range, but <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats" target="_blank">fall to the bottom</a> of the barrel at any price under that.)</p>

<p>Aside from words, numbers obviously play a key role in any crowdfunding campaigns. Kickstarter whisperer Vincent Etter <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/16/kickstarter-project-predict-within-four-hours-fail" target="_blank">says</a> founders need to be realistic about their asking prices. “Campaigns that fail usually ask for more money, over a longer time period--with the exception of video games, for which successful campaigns have a higher goal on average.” Still not sure if you're under or over-pricing yourself?--Bring in the experts. Companies like Dragon Innovation have helped Kickstarter projects including Pebble’s campaign.</p>

<p>"Crowd funding at present is a bit like the internet in 1995," Tom Walkinshaw, founder of successfully funded nano satellite startup PocketQube, told <em>New Scientist</em>. "Everyone agrees it could be really game-changing, but there is a real lack of in-depth knowledge on why some campaigns work while others just fizzle out. This could undoubtedly be beneficial to both crowd funding hopefuls and new crowd funding platforms.”</p>
