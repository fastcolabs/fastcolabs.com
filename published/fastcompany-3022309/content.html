<p>Remote-controlled quadcopters like the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24424-matterhorn-mapped-by-fleet-of-drones-in-just-6-hours.html" target="_blank">push-propeller drones that mapped the Matterhorn</a> have exploded in popularity this year. But exposed propellers make them a hazard to people, pets and birds--not to mention they’re easily breakable. The next generation of drones will be smaller and more durable, like <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24638-fourwinged-robot-flies-like-a-jellyfish.html#.UpT462RDtVo" target="_blank">this fist-sized drone that flaps through the air like a jellyfish</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear, this little aqua-inspired floater doesn’t yet have the lift of a rotor system (like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDXuGQRpvs4" target="_blank">octo-rotor pizza deliverer</a>), but it’s certainly big enough to carry a camera--which is a lead feature of the popular <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" target="_blank">AR Drone 2.0 Parrot</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.dvice.com/2013-11-4/invisible-insect-sized-drones-may-soon-be-used-us-army" target="_blank">thumb-sized drones are being tested for military use</a> for squad-based forward scouting, so the demand is there…and if folks are interested in that ⅛-pound military drone, they’ll love the jellyfish’s 2 gram weight, about 1/30th of the military drone.</p>

<p>Of course, the jellyfish is still experimental--it’s tethered to a power source, but the lead NYU researcher, Leif Ristroph, is <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24638-fourwinged-robot-flies-like-a-jellyfish.html" target="_blank">confident that fine-tuning the shape and flexibility of the wings would produce enough lift to hold a battery</a>. Aside from power, however, the ingenious upright design eliminates the need for self-righting servos and sensors, and its light weight means it can be carried on a breeze, which Ristroph suggests would benefit jellyfish drones equipped with environmental sensors.</p>

<p>But whether it’s a mountain or <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/19/watch-this-drone-automatically-map-a-countryside/" target="_blank">mapping the countryside</a>, we’re getting very good at surveilling territory and people with unmanned vehicles. This featherlight jellyfish drone is only the latest in a series of <a href="http://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/home/research/fluid-structure-interactions/biolocomotion/" target="_blank">biolocomotion</a> drones to derive lighter, more durable flying things that we could use to measure our world.</p>
