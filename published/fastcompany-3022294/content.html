<p>Location-based services are great for things like discounts at nearby restaurants, or a heads-up for traffic, or tracking a morning jog. But what if your phone could take action on your behalf in the event you drove past (say) a rogue nuclear weapon?</p>

<p>Last month on the U.S. government’s Federal Business Opportunities page, a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=d9c024a03750c850c62eff4afd96e86d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1" target="_blank">Request for Information</a> was posted for what’s being referred to as a Human Portable Tripwire system. The request serves as a sort of tentative inquiry--it’s not so much a positive indication that the federal government will move ahead with a project as it is an opportunity for private citizens to mentally prepare themselves to become de facto bomb sniffers.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the Human Portable Tripwire system would involve a wearable device that would passively scan for radiation and relay any discoveries of radioactive material back to Homeland Security via satellite phone or Internet connection. As the project calls for a passive system, it would function much like Near-Field Communication (NFC) or any other location-aware tech--once you turn it on, you don’t have to do anything else.</p>

<p>As Michael Peck writes in his breakdown of the ROI on <a href="https://medium.com/war-is-boring/21dc0b023f1d" target="_blank">Medium</a>, it’s unclear whether the system is intended for public or Department of Homeland Security use:</p>

<blockquote><p>This might be useful for security personnel patrolling an installation like a port or a large event like a major league football game. It could also mean that human tripwires could be detecting radiation as they walk the dog or take the train to work.</p></blockquote>

<p>The project might smack of Cold War-era paranoia, but should the government move forward with the Human Tripwire Project, it wouldn’t necessarily be the first initiative in recent memory that sought to crowdsource national security.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/cell-all-super-smartphones-sniff-out-suspicious-substances" target="_blank">Cell-All</a> is an initiative that began in 2007 to find a way of incorporating chemical sensors into smartphones, which would warn users and automatically notify authorities if it detected a chemical threat. While the Human Tripwire project doesn’t really have anything to do with cell phones--yet--the principle is the same: a distributed approach toward identifying and responding to threats and emergencies that attempts to mitigate the potential for human error.</p>

<p>Whether either project will ever come to fruition remains to be seen, but in a time when Internet users are actively seeking out services that will help <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014976/pro-social-software-nine-examples-of-developers-doing-good" target="_self">protect their privacy</a> and information on <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014923/a-practical-guide-to-hiding-your-online-activity" target="_self">how to do it</a> in abundance, it’s hard to see any such initiative being met with anything other than unease.</p>
