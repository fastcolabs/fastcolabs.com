<p>We’ve been amazed at the pedigree of the people who are building apps for the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/accelerator/retail" target="_self">Target &amp; Co.Labs Retail Accelerator</a>. Now we’re stepping up the level of play.</p>

<p>For the first time we’re announcing the judges for the contest. Hailing from Dropbox, Github, Mixpanel, Target, and FastCompany.com, these five minds will engage in a formidable (but friendly!) shouting match about what makes a killer retail app. Then they’ll narrow down the entries to seven in the semi-finals, and narrow again down to one to find the winner. Without further ado, they are:</p>

<p>We’re talking to the judges as the entries roll in. As they tell us what they’re looking for in the entries, we’ll post their answers here to help you hit the mark.</p>

<p><strong>Casey Carl, Target:</strong> “Mobile is the connective tissue that brings together the best of online and offline into one seamless experience. We want to see apps that develop that constant connection for our guests. Internally, we talk a lot about disseminating different experiences on phones [versus] tablets. How people are using them is dramatically different. Our guest uses her tablet on the couch, with the TV on, to do more shopping, purchasing, accessing content. People use smartphones to access information instantaneously. You need to tailor the user experience accordingly. Look at what's relevant to the guest and how you can make that experience better. For me, that factor will have the greatest weight.”</p>

<p><strong>Suhail Doshi, Mixpanel:</strong> "The best projects I've seen are driven by a clear, impactful vision and have a strong design. I've seen too many people fail because their vision is too small and they made the design and how that impacts the experience of their customers an afterthought. For commerce apps, they need to focus on giving their customers a smooth path to purchase. You need to get them from your homepage through the purchase with no roadblocks."</p>
