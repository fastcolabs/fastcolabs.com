<p>Fans of <em>Dr. Who</em> might be disappointed to know that their hero isn't <em>actually</em> parsing a screen full of code in the season seven episode "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2317659/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl" target="_blank">Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</a>." Actually, what he's looking at is an SVG file of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fa%2Fa1%2FLight-wave.svg" target="_blank">light wave</a> from Wikipedia.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jgc.org/" target="_blank">John Graham-Cumming</a>, a programmer for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>, is uncovering Hollywood's tomfoolery in his Tumblr <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Source Code in TV and Films</a>. He started pointing out what the code in popular entertainment <em>actually</em> does on January 3 when he pointed out the code in the film <em><a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/72085373569/in-the-film-elysium-the-space-station-is-rebooted" target="_blank">Elysium</a></em> was lifted from a version of the Intel Architecture Software Developerâ€™s Manual and appropriated to reboot the space station.</p>

<p>The resulting hilarity via the laziness of producers and the industry's basic assumption that viewers won't actually care enough to fact check is priceless. Case in point: <em>CSI:NY</em> trying to pass <a href="https://twitter.com/RobThez/status/419488164387250176" target="_blank">two pages of HTML headers</a> in a silly handwritten font as a hack to Gears of War.</p>

<p>Amongst the gibberish and nonsensical, though, are a few legitimate uses of programming languages. Graham-Cumming points out the SQL in <em><a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/72228662240/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-uses-apparently" target="_blank">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a></em> appears to be legitimate for researching murders. The JavaScript code from <em>Stargate SG1: The Ark of Truth</em> is correct, the only problem being that it's actually written for a <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/72208356646/in-stargate-sg1-the-ark-of-truth-there-is" target="_blank">Canadian bank</a>.</p>

<p>The Tumblr isn't long (yet), but it's worth going through the five pages of archives for a giggle and, more productively, to see a discussion happening among bored programmers. If you're time crunched, there's a <a href="http://games.usvsth3m.com/movie-code-quiz/" target="_blank">10-question quiz</a> based on posts from Graham-Cumming's findings.</p>

<p>It's amazing that "movie code" isn't compete gibberish; we figured it would be generated by something like <a href="http://hackertyper.net/" target="_blank">HackerTyper</a>, where hitting any key generates bunk code in an aesthetically-convincing sandbox. (If you're new to HackerTYper, try hitting the alt (option on a Mac) key <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/hacker-typer/" target="_blank">three times</a> and see what happens.)</p>
