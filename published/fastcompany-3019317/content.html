<p>LOS ANGELES, October 4, 2013--The USC Center for Body Computing demonstrated its BioGram app today at its 7th Annual USC Body Computing Conference. The app allows users to take their heart rate and post it on Instagram and its own photosharing tool. The app, which is not yet commercially available, is the first time biostatistical information is integrated seamlessly onto a multimedia platform for sharing.</p>

<p>“BioGram can bring biostatistical information to millions of people through an existing photo-sharing platform, and it creates data experiences that are aesthetic and emotional,” said Dr. Leslie A. Saxon, the executive director of the USC Center for Body Computing and the co-inventor of the app, which was shown publicly for the first time today. Heart rate is recorded from AliveCor’s Heart Monitor, which snaps onto the back of a mobile device to record, display, store, and transfer single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythms wirelessly. AliveCor opened its AliveCor Heart Rate API to the USC Center for Body Computing so the USC CBC--a digital health research and innovation center--could create the app.</p>

<p>Dr. Saxon said the app is a first step (she hopes to make it commercially available by the end of the year) in creating more health literacy. It can be ported to any sensor maker. “More and more devices have connected or wireless sensors that can record a person’s biostatistical data, such as heart rate. These devices include mobile phones, tablets, implantables, and fitness monitors, as well as consumer products, including automobiles, scales, refrigerators, and others. We want to leverage this technology, and harness biostatistics, for fun--and for health. It's about sharing yourself.  And becoming smarter about your health,” said Saxon.</p>

<p>Currently, biostatistical data is generally confined to the sensor or the sensor software, and does not port to multimedia applications, such as social network sites. BioGram acquires and shares the biometrics. The app was co-invented and coded by engineers at the USC CBC.</p>
