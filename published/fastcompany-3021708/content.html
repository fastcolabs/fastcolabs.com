<p>First, a parable: I did fine in Catholic school, up until 6th grade. I don't know why Sister Freda hated me, but I think she was trying to teach me a lesson. And I did learn a lesson from her--just not the one she had in mind.</p>

<p>The turning point happened like this. During a reading comprehension exercise about becoming a veterinarian, Sister Freda asked me, "Name one challenge people have in becoming a vet." I gave an answer. It was wrong. She told the entire class that this was an example of what happens when students don't pay attention. If I had done the work, she explained, I would have seen the section in the reading that held the correct answer. It was intended as a humiliating lesson.</p>

<p>At lunch, I showed Sister Freda the reading passage in my book. She apparently wanted me to regurgitate the challenges that <em>students</em> face when becoming vets. But I pointed out a later paragraph that contained my answer--that many vets struggle to run their own practices as <em>business people</em>.</p>

<p>"Ah, ok," she said, and that was it. She saw that my answer wasn’t wrong--if anything, her question had been too vague.</p>

<p>At that moment, I realized that teachers are like everyone else--they make mistakes. And if I was going to be a great student, I couldn't be so passive about my education.</p>

<p>Starting in 7th grade, I asked a ridiculous number of questions. My hand lived above my head. I forced myself to think of hypothetical or advanced questions beyond the realm of the text or the day's lesson. People groaned when I was called on.</p>

<p>I remember a fellow student turning around when tests were handed back. He noticed that I had gotten the higher score. "How did you get a 100% when you're always so confused and have to ask so many questions?"</p>

<p>Despite ridicule from my peers, I kept at it. My grades soared, and at the end of 8th grade I graduated second in my class. If only I had asked more questions, sooner.</p>

<h3><a name="Dont_Forget_The_Real_Question">Don't Forget The Real Question</a></h3>

<p>Someone emailed me recently with the subject: "A question about start-ups". But the email didn't contain a question mark or anything remotely looking like a question.</p>

<p>Often I get advice seeking emails ending with, "Do you have any feedback?"<br />
But that's not a question; it's a cop-out.</p>

<p>Similarly, I've attended meetings where entrepreneurs make presentations to experts expected to share helpful guidance. But often the presentation is, "Here's my product, what do you think?"</p>

<p>Same problem. That's not a real question. And so a conversation with these experts is unfocused and frustrates the entrepreneur because her real problems go untouched.</p>

<p>I've made the same mistake myself, but I've been lucky to learn a different way. The most valuable feedback session I ever had with a mentor came before I released <a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank">Draft</a>, my latest product to help people <a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank">write better</a>. I was prepared. Instead of asking for <em>feedback</em>, I asked how this mentor and successful entrepreneur would design a specific feature in <a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank">Draft</a> or how would he communicate the business model I had planned? I got much more than feedback; I got <em>answers</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="How_To_Ask_Better_Questions">How To Ask Better Questions</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/i-dont-have-any-connections" target="_blank">There are plenty of people who'd love to help you with your business; you just have to ask</a>, but they don't have time to waste helping you figure out what your actual problems are. Get the most out of a potential mentor by approaching them with specific questions you've already identified and they've probably answered for themselves. How would you:<br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Increase the conversion rate?</span></li>
  <li><span>Set up pricing?</span></li>
  <li><span>Design this feature so that it's clear and easy to use?</span></li>
</ul></p>

<p>And force yourself to go deeper with your questions.</p>

<p>Toyota's engineering processes are famously effective. One reason is that employees are taught to ask why five times when trying to solve a problem.<br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Why is the battery dead?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why is the alternator broken?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why didn't the customer get alerted to this before?</span></li>
</ul></p>

<p>This process helps engineers identify and fix the root problem instead of just treating symptoms. The same practice can be applied to your start-up venture.</p>

<p>Act like a Toyota engineer and ask <em>why</em> at least five times.<br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Why is my business not making enough money?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why am I not measuring my conversion and attrition rates?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why is attrition so high?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why haven't I surveyed anyone who has cancelled?</span></li>
  <li><span>Why haven't I added feature X which most canceling users are asking for?</span></li>
</ul></p>

<p>And most importantly… Don't worry about looking silly with the number of questions you have; just ask more of them.</p>
