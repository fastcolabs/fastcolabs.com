<p>Writer’s block is a made-up excuse for not doing your work (at least <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024510/six-productivity-tips-from-jerry-seinfelds-reddit-ask-me-anything" target="_self">as diagnosed by</a> comedian Jerry Seinfeld). But what if you really just need some input from other people to get your ideas moving?</p>

<p>New creative-writing app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda-for-iphone/id762675082?mt=8" target="_blank">Coda</a> is offering some assistance for people looking for a little help with their words. The iOS app lets you ask your friends or its community for input on your next sentence, verse, or whatever you’re writing.</p>

<p>While others can contribute to different people’s work, the author ultimately decides whose changes get merged into the original document, just like in GitHub or <a href="https://draftin.com" target="_blank">Draft</a>. Users login with their Twitter accounts.</p>

<p>Coda isn't the first app for writers, but it might be the best one yet on iOS. <a href="http://helpmewrite.co/" target="_blank">Help Me Write</a> is another community of people offering help writing, but the app is web-only. That service takes a different approach, helping you choose which of your ideas people are most interested in reading about before you waste time writing something irrelevant.</p>

<p>If you’re getting the uneasy feeling that all this writing “help” could create a content arms race, then that makes two of us. As more apps and services provide good ways for people to express their creative ideas, a vicious cycle could develop in which readers' expectations float steadily higher as average writers leverage more and more technology just to force their writing to make the grade.</p>

<p>Similar tools are popping up for amateur photographers too. An app called <a href="http://www.okdothis.com/" target="_blank">OkDoThis</a> is like Instagram for those who aren’t sure what to shoot; members of the app community suggest things to photograph and then the user goes out and does it. Does that still count as creativity?</p>
