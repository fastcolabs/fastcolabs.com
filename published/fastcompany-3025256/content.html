<p>This week, in an attempt to boost lackluster PC sales, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245556/HP_sticks_thumb_in_Microsoft_s_eye_discounts_consumer_Windows_7_PCs" target="_blank">Hewlett-Packard began promoting Windows 7 PCs</a> to lure customers who may be leery of Windows 8's bad rap. The company claims that Windows 7 is being brought back to its lineup due to "popular demand," leading customers to believe that the OS was previously unavailable and is now being brought back. That's not the case.</p>

<p>But as <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/hp-bringing-back-windows-7-pcs-not-so-fast-7000025351/" target="_blank">Ed Bott writes for ZDNet</a>, the promotion is merely a classic selection from the advertising playbook: making it appear as something is different--that Windows 7 is “back by popular demand”--when in fact nothing has changed at all except HP exec's priorities:</p>

<blockquote><p>In January 2014, HP offers a total of 5 PCs running Windows 7 and 68 running Windows 8 or 8.1. Last summer, HP offered 8 Windows 7 PCs and 61 Windows 8 models. Back by popular demand? Not exactly.</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, any PC manufacturer can still sell Windows 7; there’s no need for it to be brought back. According to the Microsoft’s OS support lifecycle, manufacturers could continue to sell new hardware with Windows 7 installed up until October 2014--a date that, in December, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9244687/Microsoft_retracts_Windows_7_PC_end_of_sales_deadline" target="_blank">was retracted and has not been updated</a>.</p>

<p>While we haven’t quite reached <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/save-xp" target="_blank">Windows Vista levels of fervor</a>, still <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/01/17/what-windows-9-must-do-to-avoid-flopping-like-windows-8/" target="_blank">clamor for change</a> is growing. Even after Microsoft's big Windows 8.1 update last October, the OS' adoption rate remains painfully low when compared to how its predecessors performed--in December, 14 months into it's lifecycle, Windows 8 and 8.1 combined <a href="http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/windows-8-continues-to-struggle-for-adoption/" target="_blank">only make up for 9.3% of the market share</a>. Windows 7, in comparison, had captured 17.3% of the market share <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9242048/Windows_8_surpasses_Vista_s_uptake_rate_10_months_after_launch" target="_blank">10 months after it was released</a>--almost double.</p>

<p>But change is on the way. Last week, rumors spread that Windows 9--codenamed "Threshold"--<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2322586/microsoft-might-unveil-windows-9-in-april-to-end-windows-8-woes" target="_blank">was being accelerated</a> in order to be officially announced at Microsoft’s Build conference in April. Although hopes are high for a major course correction, chances are we won’t be seeing the next Windows OS for <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/threshold-be-called-windows-9-ship-april-2015" target="_blank">at least a year</a>.</p>
