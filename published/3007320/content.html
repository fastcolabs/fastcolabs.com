<h3><a name="What_The_Hells_A_Bitcoin">What The Hell's A Bitcoin?</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>Bitcoins are a decentralized virtual currency that rely on public-key cryptography. If you buy something with a Bitcoin you're simply transmitting a symbolic token stamped with a complex number that transfers ownership to someone else. Unlike traditional banking, which keeps customer information private, Bitcoin transactions are transparent so the "market" knows when a bitcoin is spent but not the owner's identity. Money supply is increased by users who "mine" bitcoins by dedicating computer processing power to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoins are not regulated by any government or bank, and the currency has seeped into criminal activities. As a result, legislators are threatening crackdowns, and some claim it is a vast scam.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although it doesn't mention the currency by name, <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html" target="_blank">new guidance published by</a> FinCEN, part of the U.S. Treasury Department, details how it plans to regulate virtual currencies. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/" target="_blank">The guidelines require exchanges</a>, which allow users to buy and sell Bitcoins, and miners, who "find" and sell Bitcoin for other currencies, to register as "Money Services Businesses" (MSBs). MSBs are required by the government to institute anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity on their networks.</p>

<h5><a name="How_Software_Industry_Is_Adding_Legitimacy">How Software Industry Is Adding Legitimacy</a></h5>

<p>Bitcoin users are skeptical about the guidelines, but the biggest players in the budding industry are surprisingly positive. Timothy B. Lee at <em>Forbes</em> thinks the move <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/03/19/new-money-laundering-guidelines-are-a-positive-sign-for-bitcoin/" target="_blank">shows that the U.S. government doesn't see the currency as a threat</a> and won't act to shut it down. Mt.Gox, the popular Bitcoin exchange that <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/coinlab-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-with-mtgox-deal/" target="_blank">recently partnered with Silicon Valley-based startup CoinLabs</a> to make trading more liquid in the U.S., says the guidance is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4127506/bitcoin-foundation-new-us-rules-targeting-virtual-currencies-are" target="_blank">"a good step forward for Bitcoin."</a></p>

<p>Just days before the FinCEN guidelines were released, the Cyprus government announced a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/19/cyprus-parliament-rejects-savings-levy" target="_blank">now-abandoned plan to tax personal savings accounts</a> in an effort to raise enough euros to keep the country solvent. In response to the announcement, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-20/fleeing-the-euro-for-bitcoins-.html" target="_blank">downloads of Bitcoin apps shot up in Spain</a>, another country threatened by Eurozone instability. Because Bitcoin transactions do not go through a central authority, they are difficult for governments to tax.</p>

Still trying to <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007320/tracking/bitcoins-rise-reliable-currency#How_Bitcoins_Can_Rival_Fiat_Currencies" target="_self">stave off financial ruin</a>, the country has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/24/eurozone-cyprus-withdrawals-idUSL5N0CG0VA20130324" target="_blank">limited cash withdrawals</a> from the island's two biggest banks to 100 euros per day.</p>

<p>"If we did this now, and we are moving quickly to make this so, we would be the only functioning ATM on the island," writes Berwick.</p>

<p>Expensify, the plucky San Francisco-based travel expenses startup, announced that <a href="http://www.citeworld.com/cloud/21632/bitcoin-takes-big-step-mainstream-support-expensify" target="_blank">they will offer Bitcoin as an option for payouts</a>. The feature is designed to give employees a way to avoid costly transaction fees for converting currencies. Expensify is the largest and most mainstream enterprise company so far to adopt Bitcoin.</p>

<p>OkCupid, one of the world's most popular online dating sites, may be the next major, mainstream company to accept payment in Bitcoin. In email screenshots posted to Reddit, the company's support team appears to have already accepted at least two <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1alzhj/okcupid_one_of_the_biggest_dating_sites_just/" target="_blank">manual</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b3s3t/dating_site_okcupid_plans_to_accept_btc_shortly/" target="_blank">payments</a> using Bitcoin and says it's hoping to support the crypto-currency <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b8h4x/okcupid_to_support_bitcoins_in_few_months/" target="_blank">"in the next couple of months."</a> We have reached out to OkCupid and are waiting for comment.</p>

<h5><a name="The_Race_To_100">The Race To $100</a></h5>

<p>On Monday morning, Bitcoin briefly climbed above $100 for the first time on the Mt.Gox exchange, reaching a high of $101. The currency now has a market capitalization over $1 billion, making it more valuable than some sovereign currencies. Bitcoin's continued resiliency is remarkable given that even its basic infrastructure is still far from stable. Over the weekend, Mt.Gox was hit with a <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/03/29/bitcoin-under-attack-dwolla-mt-gox-both-hit-with-ddos-attacks-overnight/" target="_blank">"stronger than average"</a> denial of service attack that shut down trading and the currency briefly fell to a low of $75 on Friday on news that Cyprus will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/global/cyprus-banks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0" target="_blank">allow banks to reopen</a>.</p>
