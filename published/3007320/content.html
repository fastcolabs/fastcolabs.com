<h3><a name="What_The_Hells_A_Bitcoin">What The Hell's A Bitcoin?</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>Bitcoins are a decentralized virtual currency that rely on public-key cryptography. If you buy something with a Bitcoin you're simply transmitting a symbolic token stamped with a complex number that transfers ownership to someone else. Unlike traditional banking, which keeps customer information private, Bitcoin transactions are transparent so the "market" knows when a bitcoin is spent but not the owner's identity. Money supply is increased by users who "mine" bitcoins by dedicating computer processing power to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoins are not regulated by any government or bank, and the currency has seeped into criminal activities. As a result, legislators are threatening crackdowns, and some claim it is a vast scam.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a name="The_Harlem_Shake_of_Currency">"The Harlem Shake of Currency"</a></h5>

<p>To date, our coverage of Bitcoin has been primarily bullish. Not everyone views it that way. Heidi Moore of <em>The Guardian</em>, for example, believes that Bitcoin is being <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/03/bitcoin-currency-bubble-crash-not-rocking-financial-markets" target="_blank">blown out of proportion by finanicial media</a> due to its spike in value.</p>

<p>The article contains some debatable claims, including that it was created "to do things on the internet without getting caught," when in fact its author designed it as a <a href="https://medium.com/money-banking/2b5ef79482cb#31ad" target="_blank">reaction to the 2008 fiscal crisis</a>, and that miners "release Bitcoins at their own discretion." Still, Moore's right that despite the hype, relative to the global economy, very little value - about $1.4 billion at the moment - is tied up in Bitcoin. It could very well just be a passing fad. Even if it is, our take is that it's worth discussing because of the way the nascent crypto-currency is forcing the world to consider the shortcomings of traditional sovereign money.</p>

<p>â€œWhen drug dealers and smugglers use your currency, it's a stamp of approval," says market analyst Nicholas Colas. <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007805/tracking/why-bitcoin-doesnt-behave-money" target="_self">So why doesn't Bitcoin behave like money?</a></p>

<h5><a name="The_Race_To_100">The Race To $100</a></h5>

<p>On Monday morning, Bitcoin climbed above $100 for the first time on the Mt.Gox exchange. The currency now has a market capitalization over $1 billion, making it more valuable than some sovereign currencies. Bitcoin's continued resiliency is remarkable given that even its basic infrastructure is still far from stable. Over the weekend, Mt.Gox was hit with a <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/03/29/bitcoin-under-attack-dwolla-mt-gox-both-hit-with-ddos-attacks-overnight/" target="_blank">"stronger than average"</a> denial of service attack that shut down trading and the currency briefly fell to a low of $75 on Friday on news that Cyprus will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/global/cyprus-banks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0" target="_blank">allow banks to reopen</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="What_If_The_Bitcoin_Bubble_Is_Real">What If The Bitcoin Bubble Is Real?</a></h5>

<p>Bitcoin might well be overvalued. But what if it's overvalued for the same reason that any currency or commodity can sometimes be subject to a bubble, and not just because it's a fashionable and fascinating alternative currency?</p>

<p>We spoke with <strong><a href="http://elidourado.com/" target="_blank">Eli Dourado</a>, Research Fellow with the Technology Policy Program</strong> at George Mason University's Mercatus Center on what is driving Monday's spike in value. Dourado said there are many factors, but there's "good evidence" that the situation in Cyprus is on trader's minds, even if they aren't in the island nation.</p>

<blockquote><p>It could even be people in the U.S. realizing that Spanish people are interested and so they preemptively bid up the currency. So it could be complicated series of events driving up the price even if it's Cyprus.<br />
<strong>-Eli Dourado</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Last week, a suggestion by Euro Group President Jeroen Dijsselbloem that Cyprus' handling of the crisis <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/cyprus-bank-bailout-model-has-increasing-numbers-of-adherents-in-eu-a-891849.html" target="_blank">might be a "model" for other countries</a> caused markets to drop. Dourado believes this announcement may have triggered increased interest in Bitcoin, but he doesn't think the crypto-currency's sudden popularity is different from any other hedge investment.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think it's only a good hedge if at some point there's a way to spend it. If they didn't think there was going to be a good way to spend it they would probably buy gold.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dourado was also quick to dispose with the notion that Bitcoin is enabling small investors to escape regulations.</p>

<blockquote><p>The people who are moving money around in response to this crisis are probably not your grandmother worrying about her bank balance and saying, "I'm going to buy Bitcoin with my bank balance." These are more sophisticated people likely to be targeted by these government haircuts.</p></blockquote>

<p>OkCupid, one of the world's most popular online dating sites, may be the next major, mainstream company to accept payment in Bitcoin.

<h5><a name="Why_The_US_Government_Wants_To_Regulate">Why The US Government Wants To Regulate</a></h5>

<p>Although it doesn't mention the currency by name, <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html" target="_blank">new guidance published by</a> FinCEN, part of the U.S. Treasury Department, details how it plans to regulate virtual currencies. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/us-regulator-bitcoin-exchanges-must-comply-with-money-laundering-laws/" target="_blank">The guidelines require exchanges</a>, which allow users to buy and sell Bitcoins, and miners, who "find" and sell Bitcoin for other currencies, to register as "Money Services Businesses" (MSBs). MSBs are required by the government to institute anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity on their networks.</p>

<h5><a name="How_Software_Industry_Is_Adding_Legitimacy">How Software Industry Is Adding Legitimacy</a></h5>

<p>Bitcoin users are skeptical about the guidelines, but the biggest players in the budding industry are surprisingly positive. Timothy B. Lee at <em>Forbes</em> thinks the move <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/03/19/new-money-laundering-guidelines-are-a-positive-sign-for-bitcoin/" target="_blank">shows that the U.S. government doesn't see the currency as a threat</a> and won't act to shut it down. Mt.Gox, the popular Bitcoin exchange that <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/coinlab-bringing-bitcoin-to-wall-street-with-mtgox-deal/" target="_blank">recently partnered with Silicon Valley-based startup CoinLabs</a> to make trading more liquid in the U.S., says the guidance is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4127506/bitcoin-foundation-new-us-rules-targeting-virtual-currencies-are" target="_blank">"a good step forward for Bitcoin."</a></p>

<h5><a name="How_Bitcoins_Can_Rival_Fiat_Currencies">How Bitcoins Can Rival Fiat Currencies</a></h5>

<p>Just days before the FinCEN guidelines were released, the Cyprus government announced a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/19/cyprus-parliament-rejects-savings-levy" target="_blank">now-abandoned plan to tax personal savings accounts</a> in an effort to raise enough euros to keep the country solvent. In response to the announcement, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-20/fleeing-the-euro-for-bitcoins-.html" target="_blank">downloads of Bitcoin apps shot up in Spain</a>, another country threatened by Eurozone instability. Because Bitcoin transactions do not go through a central authority, they are difficult for governments to tax.</p>
