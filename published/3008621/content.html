<p>While it’s counterintuitive, charts can actually obscure our understanding of data--a trick Steve Jobs has exploited on stage at least once. Of course, you don’t have to be a cunning CEO to misuse charts; in fact, If you have ever used one at all, you probably did so incorrectly, according to visualization architect and interactive news developer <a href="https://twitter.com/driven_by_data" target="_blank">Gregor Aisch</a>. Aisch gave a series of workshops at the <a href="http://" target="_blank"></a> in Italy which I attended last weekend, including one on <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2013/04/26/data-visualization-guidelines-by-gregor-aisch-international-journalism-festival/" target="_blank">basic visualization guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>“I would distinguish between misuse by accident and on purpose,” Aisch says.”Misuse on purpose is rare. The famous <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/15/live-from-macworld-2008-steve-jobs-keynote/" target="_blank">2008 Apple keynote</a> from Steve Jobs is one example of misuse by accident. He showed the market share of different smartphone vendors in a 3D pie chart. The Apple slice of the smartphone market, which was one of the smallest, was in front so it appeared bigger.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Aisch explained in his presentation that 3D pie charts should be avoided at all costs since the perspective distorts the data. What is displayed in front is perceived as more important than what is shown in the background. That 19.5% of market share belonging to Apple takes up 31.5% of the entire area of the pie chart and the angles are also distorted. The data looks completely different when presented in a different order as shown below.</p>

<p>In fact, the humble pie charts turns out to be an <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2013/04/26/data-visualization-guidelines-by-gregor-aisch-international-journalism-festival/" target="_blank">unexpected mine field</a>: <br />
	 	 	 	<br />
<blockquote><p>“Use pie charts with care, and only to show part of whole relationships. Two is the ideal number of slices, but never show more than five. Don’t use pie charts if you want to compare values. Use bar charts instead.”</p></blockquote></p>

<p>For example, Aisch advises that you don’t use pie charts to compare sales from different years but do use to show sales per product in the current year. You should also ensure that you <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2013/04/26/data-visualization-guidelines-by-gregor-aisch-international-journalism-festival/" target="_blank">don't leave out data on part of the whole</a>:</p>

<figure class="inline-large inline">

</figure>

<blockquote><p> “Use line charts to show time series data. That’s simply the best way to show how a variable changes over time. Avoid stacked area charts, they are easily mis-interpreted.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The “<a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/11/i-hate-stacked-area-charts/" target="_blank">I hate stack area charts</a>” post cited in Aisch’s talk explains why:</p>

<figure class="inline-large inline">

</figure>

<blockquote><p> “Orange started out dominating the market, but Blue expanded rapidly and took over. To the unwary, it looks like Green lost a bit of market share. Not nearly as much as Orange, of course, but the green swath certainly gets thinner as we move to the right end of the chart.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/11/i-hate-stacked-area-charts/" target="_blank">the underlying data</a> shows that Green’s market share has been increasing, not decreasing. The chart plots the market share vertically, but human beings perceive the thickness of a stream at right angles to its general direction.</p>

</figure>

<p>Technology companies aren't the only offenders in chart misuse. “Half of the examples in the presentation are from news organisations. Fox news is famous for this,” Aisch explains.”The emergence of interactive online maps has made map misuse very popular, e.g. Election results in the United states where big states like Texas which have small populations are marked red. If you build a map with Google Maps there isn't really a way to get around this problem. But other tools aren't there yet in terms of user interface and you need special skills to use them.”</p>

<p>Google Maps also uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" target="_blank">Mercator projection</a>, a method of projecting the sphere of the Earth onto a flat surface, which distorts the size of areas closer to the polar regions so, for example, Greenland looks as large as Africa.</p>

</figure>

<p>The solution, according to Aisch, is to build visualization best practices directly into the tools such as his own open source visualization tool <a href="http://datawrapper.de/" target="_blank">Datawrapper</a>. “In Datawrapper we set meaningful defaults but also allow you to switch between different rule systems. There's an example for labelling a line chart. There is some advice that <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">Edward Tufte gave in one of his books</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Street-Journal-Guide-Information-Graphics/dp/0393072959" target="_blank">different advice from Donna Wong</a> so you can switch between them. We also look at the data so if you visualize a data set which has many rows, then the line chart will display in a different way than if there were just 3 rows.”</p>

We’re Tracking This Story[h/5]

<p>Take lots of data and analyze it: That’s what data scientists do and it’s yielding all sorts of conclusions that weren’t previously attainable. We can discover how our <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/nyregion/mayor-bloombergs-geek-squad.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=3&amp;amp;%5Dcities" target="_blank">cities are run</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007178" target="_self">disasters are tackled</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21575820-how-software-helps-firms-hire-workers-more-efficiently-robot-recruiters" target="_blank">workers are hired</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/23/crimesourcing-crime-as-a-service-and-how-data-criminals-are-like-startup-employees/" target="_blank">crimes are committed</a>, or even how <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/03/saint-james-infirmary-checking-the-pulse-of-health-it-at-himss.html" target="_blank">Cupid's arrows find their mark</a>. Conclusions derived from data are affecting our lives and are likely to shape much of the future.</p>

<p>This story will track the techniques, technologies, tools, and people behind the Big Data curtain. From data scientists to data skeptics, Big Data technologies to DIY visualization tools, we will cover everything that the data-curious developer, or budding data enthusiast, needs to know about data.</p>

<p><strong>The rush to "simplify" big data is the source of a lot of reductive thinking about its utility.</strong> Data science practitioners have <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/04/04/k-nearest-neighbors-dangerously-simple/" target="_blank">recently been lamenting</a> how the data gold rush is leading to naive practitioners deriving misleading or even downright dangerous conclusions from data.</p>

<p>The Register recently <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/13/open_and_shut/" target="_blank">mentioned two trends</a> that may reduce the role of the professional data scientist before the hype has even reached its peak. The first is the embedding of Big Data tech in applications. The other is <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/svetlana-sicular/data-scientist-mystified/" target="_blank">increased training for existing employees who can benefit from data tools</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Organizations already have people who know their own data better than mystical data scientists. Learning Hadoop is easier than learning the company’s business." </p></blockquote>

<p>This trend has already taken hold in data visualization, where tools like <a href="http://infogr.am/" target="_blank">infogr.am</a> are making it easy for anyone to make a decent-looking infographic from a small data set. But this is exactly the type of thing that has some data scientists worried. Cathy O' Neil (aka <a href="http://mathbabe.org/" target="_blank">MathBabe</a>) has the following to say <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2013/04/04/k-nearest-neighbors-dangerously-simple/" target="_blank">in a recent post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It’s tempting to bypass professional data scientists altogether and try to replace them with software. I’m here to say, it’s not clear that’s possible. Even the simplest algorithm, like k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), can be naively misused by someone who doesn’t understand it well."</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm" target="_blank">K-nearest neighbors</a> is a clustering algorithm which allows you to automatically discover categories based on examples of something, let's say visitors to your website, by putting them into clusters of "similar" visitors based on their attributes. But while the algorithm is simple, selecting the correct settings and knowing that you need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling" target="_blank">scale feature values</a> (or verifying that you don't have many redundant features) may be less obvious.</p>

<blockquote><p>You would not necessarily think about this problem if you were just pressing a big button on a dashboard called “k-NN me!”</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Here are four problems that typically arise from a lack of scientific rigor in data projects.</strong> Anthony Chong, head of optimization at <a href="http://www.adaptly.com/" target="_blank">Adaptly</a>,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/04/01/the-dangers-of-cargo-cult-data-science/" target="_blank"> warns us to look out for "science" with no scientific integrity</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Through phony measurement and poor understandings of statistics, we risk creating an industry defined by dubious conclusions and myriad false alarms.... What distinguishes science from conjecture is the scientific method that accompanies it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Given the extent to which conclusions derived from data will shape our future lives, this is an important issue. Chong gives us four problems that typically arise from a lack of scientific rigor in data projects, but are rarely acknowledged.</p>

<ol>
  <li><span>Results not transferrable</span></li>
  <li><span>Experiments not repeatable</span></li>
  <li><span>Not inferring causation: Chong insists that the only way to infer causation is randomized testing. It can't be done from observational data or by using machine learning tools, which predict correlations with no causal structure. </span></li>
  <li><span>Poor and statistically insignificant recommendations.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Even when properly rigorous, analysis often leads to nothing at all. From Jim Manzi's 2012 book, <u>Uncontrolled: The Suprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business</u>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Google ran approximately 12,000 randomized experiments in 2009, with [only] about 10 percent of these leading to business changes.”</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Understanding data isn't about your academic abilities—it's about experience.</strong> Beau Cronin has some words of encouragement for engineers who specialize in storage and machine learning. Despite all the backend-as-service companies sprouting up, it seems there will always be a place for someone who truly understands the underlying architecture. Via <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/04/a-different-take-on-data-skepticism.html" target="_blank">his post at O'Relly Radar</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I find the database analogy useful here: Developers with only a foggy notion of database implementation routinely benefit from the expertise of the programmers who do understand these systems—i.e., the “professionals.” How? Well, decades of experience—and lots of trial and error—have yielded good abstractions in this area.... For ML (machine learning) to have a similarly broad impact, I think the tools need to follow a similar path.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Want to climb the mountain? Start learning about data science here.</strong> If you know next to nothing about Big Data tools, <a href="http://greendatacenterconference.com/blog/top-ten-emerging-big-data-technologies/" target="_blank">HP's Dr. Satwant Kaur's 10 Big data technologies </a> is a good place to start. It contains short descriptions of Big Data infrastructure basics from databases to machine learning tools.</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45085154/meetup/mapreduce-100329102056-phpapp02.pdf" target="_blank">This slide show</a> explains one of the most common technologies in the Big Data world, MapReduce, using fruit while Emcien CEO Radhika Subramanian <a href="http://smartdatacollective.com/radhikaatemcien/104206/de-mystifying-hadoop-not-all-problems-are-hadoop-able" target="_blank"> tells you why not every problem is suitable for its most popular implementation Hadoop</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Rather than break the data into pieces and store-n-query, organizations need the ability to detect patterns and gain insights from their data. Hadoop destroys the naturally occurring patterns and connections because its functionality is based on breaking up data. The problem is that most organizations don’t know that their data can be represented as a graph nor the possibilities that come with leveraging connections within the data."</p></blockquote>

<p>Efraim Moscovich's <a href="http://www.ca.com/~/media/Files/About%20Us/CATX/big-data-for-conventional-programmers-moscovich.pdf" target="_blank">Big Data for conventional programmers</a> goes into much more detail on many of the top 10, including code snippets and pros and cons. He also gives a nice summary of the Big Data problem from a developer's point of view.</p>

<blockquote><p>We have lots of resources (thousands of cheap PCs), but they are very hard to utilize.<br />
We have clusters with more than 10k cores, but it is hard to program 10k concurrent threads.<br />
We have thousands of storage devices, but some may break daily.<br />
We have petabytes of storage, but deployment and management is a big headache.<br />
We have petabytes of data, but analyzing it is difﬁcult.<br />
We have a lot of programming skills, but using them for Big Data processing is not simple.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.infochimps.com/" target="_blank">Infochimps</a> has also created a nice overview of data tools (which features in Techcrunch's <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/big-data-right-now-five-trendy-open-source-technologies/#comment-box" target="_blank">top five open-source projects article</a>) and what they are used for.</p>
