<p>One benefit of having intelligent readers is hearing them talk back through social media. Of course, we hardly know anything about that. So we're tracking daily praise for CoLab--blind, batty, and backhanded--in the hopes of beating our code &amp; content into something our users love. We like praise, but we like honesty better. Let us know what you (really) think about what's in the news and what's on our site: tweet @fastcolabs or find us on App.net, Tumblr, Facebook or Google+.</p>
