<p>There’s an irony to Twitter these days. It's defined by its limitations--140 characters--but those limitations may be getting in the way of its larger ambitions. With <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/us-twitter-results-idUSBREA141ZZ20140205" target="_blank">investors to please</a>, the company is now focused on <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMaude/status/413752073235468289/photo/1" target="_blank">how it will grow</a>, or solve the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/11/07/twitters-ceo-our-growth-will-come-from-tv-integration-and-better-onboarding/" target="_blank">well-documented</a> problem of getting people to stay active once they sign up. To do that, they may have to start axing long-beloved features.</p>

<p>Twitter's 140-character limit has caused a strange nomenclature of its own to crop up--one of RTs, DMs, @s, #s, MTs, and so forth. And so when news broke that Twitter was experimenting with <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/is-twitter-phasing-out-hashtags-and-at-replies" target="_blank">phasing out @replies</a> (and possibly hashtags) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-axes-at-symbol-2014-3" target="_blank">many speculated</a> that it was because they were outdated, complicated conventions that only stood in the way of attracting new users.</p>

<p>“They're doing what mature companies do,” says Ragy Thomas, founder and CEO of social media marketing platform <a href="http://www.sprinklr.com/" target="_blank">Sprinklr</a>. “Which is watch what their users need and watch what their potential viewers view as friction points and optimize for those needs.”</p>

<p>According to Thomas, social media has normalized around the concepts that @replies and hashtags were intended to represent. Since people are now familiar with calling out other users and topics in a message stream, the argument goes, it’s no longer necessary to have special tags.</p>

<p>“Twitter is now bigger than those constructs, and they no longer need them for it to grow, or connect people around content--this is just evolution. All is well in the universe.”</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.lauradhamilton.com/" target="_blank">Laura Hamilton</a>, founder and CEO of startup <a href="http://www.additiveanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Additive Analytics</a>, a move like this might help, but it could also be Twitter missing the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>“It's tough to get started on Twitter as a new content creator. When you first create an account, you have no followers,” says Hamilton. “Twitter starts to suggest some accounts for you to follow, but typically those are… people [who] are very unlikely to follow back a new user. It's disheartening for a new user who's tweeting original, fresh content but not getting many followers. I think a lot of would-be content-producers drop off at that stage.”</p>

<p>Instead, Hamilton believes that Twitter could do more to foster communities aligned with interests, to allow a network of strangers to grow more organically, perhaps according to location or profession. According to Hamilton, it’s not learning Twitter that’s hard--although she does admit that the interface can be “a bit confusing”--but participating in it.</p>

<p>“When a user engages with Twitter for the first time, they quickly ask themselves, 'Why is this helpful? Why is this interesting?'” says Jessica Lawrence, executive director of <a href="http://nytm.org/" target="_blank">New York Tech Meetup</a>. “If the answers to those questions aren't good enough, they see no real point in continuing to engage. Phasing out the @ symbol and hashtag may make the experience a bit more user-friendly, but I think that is just scratching the surface.”</p>

<p>Both Lawrence and Hamilton believe that, while new users might appreciate the potential of a more streamlined Twitter experience, the service's frustrations lie elsewhere. But when I asked danah boyd, principal researcher at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newengland/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> about this, she took a stronger stance altogether.</p>

<p>“Every system requires learning the norms and affordances of the system,” says boyd. “Historically, barriers have often been part of what made the system exciting to users. Think: MySpace and backgrounds.” Geeky constructions like hashtags, boyd points out, are now used for late-night talk show skits and billboards and movie marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>“And, frankly,” boyd says, “you don't need to know how to use these things to use Twitter. So the frame still doesn't seem quite right.”</p>
