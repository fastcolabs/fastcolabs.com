<p>There are a few intrepid companies attempting to reconcile the ever-more-fragmented ecosystem of local and cloud storage. One such company is Bitcasa, which has famously offers infinite cloud storage space for about $100 a year. The company's patented reduplication algorithm is the key to making this price point profitable, but founder and lead developer Tony Gauda says that cross-platform testing is the real challenge. And you thought cross-browser testing was a pain.</p>

<p>"If you’re doing Web development, you know that certain Web browser maintain consistently for example, IE this way, Chrome this way etc., but it’s not the same when talking about operating systems on OS itself. It is an environment that has multiple variables--for example, someone can be using a Mac OS in Chinese with Google local installed. There are also many different hardware [specifications] that need adapting to, and some have faster processes than others--it [depends on] the complexity of the environment. Making it work is all about testing, testing testing. We test on 7 platforms, let [tests] run for days with multiple configurations. Changes can’t go instantly. Also, a lot of people don’t upgrade! So as user base increases there are more variables, but we are getting much better at understanding what these variables to ensure everything works consistently on every platform."</p>
