<p>Tim Cook flew to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/china" target="_self">China</a> to help court China Mobile's 760 million subscribers, but unlike the iPhone's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRwcIumf-mI" target="_blank">well documented</a> U.S. launches, about a dozen people lined up to buy the newest iPhone early Friday morning, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/apples-latest-foray-into-china-gets-a-weak-response.html?smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>China Mobile's agreement with <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/apple" target="_self">Apple</a> had <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3023375/fast-feed/china-already-going-nuts-for-iphone-5s" target="_self">people in China going nuts about the news</a> since the announcement was confirmed in December. The move was critical to Apple's global reach even though its share of the market has been steadily rising since 2012.</p>

<p>But don't let the lukewarm reception in Beijing fool you. By Wednesday of this week, a China Mobile spokesperson told <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-china-mobile-launch-could-spark-a-costly-subsidy-war-2014-1" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> that 1.3 million reservations for the iPhone had already been placed, though Reuters checked that figure and reported several discrepancies because of registrations made using fake numbers.</p>

<p>The main feature to entice customers to switch to China Mobile's iPhones will be the faster 4G network; the two other carriers currently selling iPhones only offer older generations of the phone. Yet, with a hefty pice tag of 5,288 yuan ($867 USD) for the 5S or the slightly more affordable 5C at 4,488 yuan ($741 USD), Apple will have difficulty doing so. To put that in perspective, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/world/asia/survey-in-china-shows-wide-income-gap.html" target="_blank">average monthly income for a family in China</a> is $2,100 USD, so the newest iPhone iteration would deplete the average family of monthly finances. And unlike the U.S., post-paid contracts aren't the norm; only <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/12/11/apple-china-mobile-iphone-users-may-come-at-competitors-expense-says-bernstein/" target="_blank">about 100 million of China's 760 million subscribers are post-paid</a>, meaning the rest aren't eligible for the carrier subsidies that make iPhones cheaper in the U.S.</p>

<p>According to Bernstein Researchâ€™s Toni Sacconaghi, that puts China Mobile's tangible addressable iPhone market <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/12/11/apple-china-mobile-iphone-users-may-come-at-competitors-expense-says-bernstein/" target="_blank">at only 10 million</a>. That could change if the iPhone drives more people into post-paid contracts. Jeffries analyst Cynthia Meng <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-china-mobile-launch-could-spark-a-costly-subsidy-war-2014-1" target="_blank">said</a> that China Mobile's sales will reach 12 million in its 2014 fiscal year, but its subsidies will leap 57% to 42.4 billion yuan ($7 billion), up from 27 billion yuan in its fiscal year 2013.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, there are a reported 45 million people using iPhones on China Mobile's network already. Smuggling iPhones in from Hong Kong and through other channels is commonplace, which saves people a considerable amount of money on the hardware. Still, Samsung and other Chinese companies reign supreme when it comes to smartphone sales. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/samsung" target="_self">Samsung</a> comes in China's top spot with more than 18% market share offering multiple affordable smartphone options.</p>
