<p>When you’re launching a startup, what’s the one thing you need? Initial funds? Organization? A plan? Well, yes--but also tools. Fortunately for entrepreneurs, there are tons of web apps out there--many of them free--to help handle the business side while you catapult your product into the market.</p>

<h3><a name="1_urlhttpsbackopscoBackopscourl">1. <a href="https://backops.co/" target="_blank">Backops.co</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Back office number crunching</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Keep all your accounting and HR reports in the cloud to keep everything straight--and saved.</p>

<h3><a name="2_urlhttpappicalnetAppicalneturl">2. <a href="http://appical.net/" target="_blank">Appical.net</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Onboarding new employees.</p>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Finding new employees via social networks.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Zao is basically a referral program based on social media. You can see how you’re connected to candidates, use a sign-up wizard to post jobs, and makes it easy for people to refer friends based on skill set.</p>

<h3><a name="4_urlhttpswwwpipedrivecomenhomequotesPipedriveurl">4. <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/home/quotes" target="_blank">Pipedrive</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Sales CRM.</p>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Conference calls</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> If you’re really on a strict budget, then a conferencing platform like Skype is going to be your first thought. But keep in mind--that can backfire. Some clients get wary doing business with companies that might have to rely on a free service to conduct partnerships.</p>

<h3><a name="8_urlhttpswwwexpensifycomExpensifyurl">8. <a href="https://www.expensify.com/" target="_blank">Expensify</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Bookkeeping</p>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Document signing</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> EchoSign is a simple concept: online signature software. If you need something signed by multiple parties, get it done by e-signing. E-sign a document, send it back, track its status, and check it off your to-do list.</p>

<h3><a name="10_urlhttpswwwdocracycomDocracyurl">10. <a href="https://www.docracy.com/" target="_blank">Docracy</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> Collaborating on legal docs.</p>

<h3><a name="Project_Management">Project Management</a></h3>

<p>When you’re launching a business, you need to make sure you’re spending the right kind of time on the right kind of tasks. Enter project management.</p>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> an all-encompassing view of your team’s productivity and capacity.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Use this interactive <a href="http://www.10000ft.com/features" target="_blank">scheduling system</a> to see which team members have the capacity to take on tasks, which ones are tied up, and which projects are coming down the pipeline. Use the status bar to keep team members updated on where the company’s at, adjust budgets, reschedules deadlines, and make sure the right people are working on the right things.</p>

You can accept or reject changes, keep track of how many tasks are getting completed, and monitor progress to find out what your biggest bottlenecks are.</p>

<h3><a name="13_urlhttpcasualpmCasualurl">13. <a href="http://casual.pm/" target="_blank">Casual</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> a small or medium sized team that routinely does similar projects--mostly because once you create a workflow, you can then reuse the template.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Casual is less a scheduling assistant and more a <a href="http://casual.pm/" target="_blank">workflow manager</a>. It’s great for the planning stages. You can set out the big picture, and then create a workflow that stems from the main idea.</p>

<h3><a name="17_urlhttpsiftttcomIFTTTurl">17. <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>Great for:</strong> automating social media actions.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> IFTTT (if this then that) is a great way to <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2293592/leveraging-ifttt-for-seo-and-social-media" target="_blank">collect social data</a>. Say you want to post a message on all of your social media presences. That takes time, having to visit all the channels. With IFTTT though, you can post once and have it syndicated to the rest. How? If this, then that. Twitter becomes your “if.” You select the trigger you want, and then add a hashtag to your status that signals it’s a tweet you want posted across all your other online social media presences.</p>

<h3><a name="18_urlhttpwwwbuzzbundlecomBuzz_Bundleurl">18. <a href="http://www.buzzbundle.com/" target="_blank">Buzz Bundle</a></a></h3>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> It bundles together keywords, brand mentions, reviews, and links while still managing your social media accounts. You can schedule posts out, comment in forums, and create multiple personas in the same place.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of <a href="http://www.buzzbundle.com/" target="_blank">Buzz Bundle</a> for a startup is that it can eliminate the need to hire a social media-only employee--you can create tons of personas from behind a proxy that makes it seem as if you’re posting from different locations.</p>
