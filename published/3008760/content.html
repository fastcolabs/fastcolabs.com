<p><strong>Engineer thinking can be a double-edged sword for entrepreneurial developers.</strong> To survive the startup process, you need to solve a problem you truly care about. But to really care about a problem, usually means it's a difficult problem. Gentry Underwood, whose app Mailbox was just acquired by Dropbox, says this creates something of a lopsided software market. From our extended interview with Underwood LINK TKTKTKTK:</p>

<p>"There's zillions of similar products for people that sit at their desk all day coding on 27-inch monitors, because that's everybody building for themselves. In either case, picking something that you really want to fix and starting up around that, I think it dramatically increases your chances of success."</p>

<p>There are two layers here, the one where you think like the engineer you are, and the other where you consider the business proposition—it even feels awkward writing such heresy, but bear with me.</p>

<p>Thinking like a programmer means solving a problem that you know intimately. That's smart, because you won't lose interest in the problem; you don't need to put energy into the empathy required to understand your users.</p>

<p>On the flip side, building an app for someone just like you can mean entering a segment already crowded with competitors and inexpensive, low margin apps. Meanwhile, there’s a dearth of software in areas that probably seem a bit far afield, for instance fashion design or construction.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to spend some time thinking un-like an engineer. After all, plenty of us geeks have humanities degrees!</p>
