<p>Modern tools like GPS and cell-phone tracking make police surveillance dramatically easier and cheaper than ever before, two privacy experts <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal-pocket-part/constitutional-law/tiny-constables-and-the-cost-of-surveillance%3A-making-cents-out-of-united-states-v.-jones" target="_blank">say</a> this month in the <em>Yale Law Journal</em>. In 2012, for instance, the FBI had about 3,000 GPS tracking devices deployed on suspects' cars across the U.S., they say--a level of vehicle surveillance they estimate wouldn't have been possible even with every FBI agent in the field tailing cars for 24 hours every day.</p>

<p>When new techniques make monitoring the public literally orders of magnitude cheaper, they argue, courts ought to see that as a sign that the new methods are violating traditional expectations of privacy and keep a close watch on how officers are using those tools.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1259.htm" target="_blank">ruled</a> in United States v. Jones in 2012 that police monitoring a GPS unit and transmitter they attached to a suspect's car without a proper warrant violated his Fourth Amendment rights. But the justices were divided on how to determine when a new law enforcement tool requires a warrant or other court scrutiny, argues the paper by Kevin Bankston, the policy director of the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute, and independent privacy researcher Ashkan Soltani.</p>

<p>"Trying to make sense of the Jones concurrences and reduce them to a clear and administrable rule--or, alternatively, arguing that they make no sense and cannot be so reduced--has become something of a cottage industry amongst privacy law scholars," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>They argue that people's expectations of privacy are driven by a mix of legal restrictions and practical restrictions--like the fact that the FBI can't deploy all of its agents to follow suspects without sleep for days at a time. So, they say, when new technology makes surveillance cheaper by an order of magnitude--that is, when the dollar cost falls by a factor of 10--courts should recognize that an existing expectation of privacy is likely being breached.</p>

<p>"Drawing the line at an order of magnitude is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, " they write, "but is also an indisputable benchmark and easily applicable test for whether or not a particular type of surveillance has become radically less expensive, which is ultimately the question on which we are suggesting courts focus."</p>

<p>Automated GPS logging with a hidden transmitter that sends a car's location to a central server costs about 36 cents per hour, while actually following a suspect's car costs hundreds of dollars in agent salaries per hour, the authors estimate, so the threshold would be met.</p>

<p>On the other hand, switching from a standard five-agent surveillance team to using a more primitive short-range transmitter that lets one pair of agents trail the car from up to a couple miles away only cuts costs by about 60%, so it wouldn't be treated as a fundamental change.</p>

<p>"Using order-of-magnitude difference as a rule of thumb is just one way of using cost as a metric, and we welcome other such proposals for assessing whether a radical technology-prompted rights-shift has occurred," the authors wrote.</p>
