<p><a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> has released its yearly list of the most unusual questions employers asked in interviews to <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024613/forget-resumes-and-hire-by-audition-to-find-the-best-employees" target="_self">stretch</a> the interviewees' creativity and problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>The number one question comes from an interview with <a href="http://www.zappos.com/" target="_blank">Zappos</a>: "If you could throw a parade of any caliber through the Zappos office what type of parade would it be?"</p>

<p>Others reflected the company's core competencies better. "How does the internet work?" asked <a href="http://www.akamai.com/" target="_blank">Akamai</a>, a cloud-service company.</p>

<p>Some tested compassion and empathy levels: "What is your least favorite thing about humanity?" asked <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/" target="_blank">ZocDoc</a>.</p>

<p>"How honest are you?" asked <a href="http://www.alliedtelesis.com/" target="_blank">Allied Telesis</a>, an IP/Ethernet network provider.</p>

<p>While others asked about relatability, "What is the funniest thing that has happened to you recently?" asked Applebee's.</p>

<p>Other favorites:<br />
<ul>
  <li><span>How lucky are you and why? (<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>)</span></li>
  <li><span>If you were a pizza deliveryman how would you benefit from scissors? (Apple)</span></li>
  <li><span>Do you believe in Big Foot? (<a href="http://www.ncl.com/" target="_blank">Norwegian Cruise Line</a>)</span></li>
  <li><span>Can you instruct someone how to make an origami "cootie catcher" with just words? (<a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/" target="_blank">LivingSocial</a>)</span></li>
  <li><span>How many snow shovels sold in the US last year? (<a href="http://www.taser.com/" target="_blank">TASER</a> (yikes))</span></li>
</ul>
There's no definitive way to prepare for questions like these--the whole point is to see if you're prepared for anything, to test your confidence levels, and see if you're "<a href="http://info.exactsource.com/blog/bid/259693/Weird-Interview-Questions-Why-They-re-Asked-and-How-to-Answer-Them" target="_blank">capable of an original thought</a>." Don't overthink it. Just think freely and clearly: What kind of parade would I want here?</p>

<p>Not everybody thinks the brainteasers are <a href="http://business.time.com/2012/10/23/no-brainer-brainteaser-job-interview-questions-dont-work/" target="_blank">worth much</a> anyway. <a href="http://business.time.com/2012/10/23/no-brainer-brainteaser-job-interview-questions-dont-work/" target="_blank">Research</a> has shown that many people don't even know how interpret the puzzlers:</p>

<blockquote><p>Participants in experiments did a better job of assessing a personâ€™s skill level after listening to responses to conventional questions than they did after hearing answers to puzzle questions. [It is] theorized that because the questions are, by nature, difficult and ambiguous, people listening to the answers were impressed with something that sounded right, whether or not it actually was.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, make sure the person you're interviewing with is someone you'd <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024451/should-i-work-for-this-guy-a-secret-that-will-help-you-decide" target="_self">want to work for</a>--think about <em>their</em> job history. Ask about their employee retention and how long they worked at their previous jobs before becoming a manager or starting their own company. It'll usually give you a pretty good idea about their propensity for handling stress.</p>
