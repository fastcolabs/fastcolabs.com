<p>What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors take the guesswork out of developing a web page but routinely trim features and customization to get the user interface usable by the unskilled Internet layman. Unfortunately, that leaves experienced web designers far outside the WYSIWYG demographic--but a new web design editor hopes to change all that with Macaw, a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1658523427/macaw-the-code-savvy-web-design-tool" target="_blank">Photoshop-esque visual editor and algorithmic code-simplifier all wrapped into a WYSIWG web app</a> that experienced web designers will love.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is a web-design tool, not a website-creating code editing platform: It translates your visual alterations into HTML and CSS code. The visual editing tools are diverse and accessible, with layer-style grouping and CSS3 shading and background options. The app is designed with fluidity in mind, respecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">responsive web design</a>: the page (and background grid) adjusts as you pinch and pull the base field. Full-screen mode visualizes end-stage “browser view,” illustrating implemented changes and orientation of elements: Whether they move with page scrolling or stay anchored in position, objects and elements appear as you styled them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest feature is the powerful algorithm that consolidates the produced code into the most succinct language possible. For that, the Macaw developers created the Alchemy design-to-code engine from scratch, which ditches the standard chunk-by-chunk code processing in favor of making rapid associations across the entire body of code--resulting in orderly, logical code that a developer would want to use.</p>

<p>Key to user control of this code is the Overview macrotab on the editing panel: consciously based on the cascading list of layers in Photoshop, the Overview lists groups and allows you to rename them to either HTML-recognized terms (e.g. “header”, helpfully colored green to indicate HTML compatibility) or semantic terms (colored white). The end code is appropriately styled and grouped in HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Macaw is powerful and, at a $99 Kickstarter price point, is comparable to <a href="http://www.theescapers.com/flux/" target="_blank">Flux 4</a>,yet far more powerful, and easier to use than the <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/software/adobe-muse-test-drive-is-it-worth-15-per-month/" target="_blank">problematic Adobe Muse</a> (which becomes more expensive than Macaw after seven $15 payments for its monthly license). As it’s already raised over $50,000 toward its $75,000 goal within two days of launch, Macaw will likely be in your hands by January 2014, but only for OS X--Windows users will have to wait a few more months.</p>
