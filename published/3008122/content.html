<p>When the file system becomes abstracted, UI is what matters most. And because mobile devices are limited to one screen at a time, it's crucial that a mobile OS have a great interface for <em>executing workflows between apps</em> in a way that makes sense.</p>

<p>One reason the Windows Phone has struggled is the limited number of actions available on content; the platform lacks the hooks (in iOS) or intents (in Android) that make it easy to integrate a third-party actions into some of the most commonly-used stock views, the way ActionSheets in iOS do, for example. So despite what this <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/04/local-storage-isnt-really-local-any-more/" target="_blank">guest author from Microsoft says</a> on Wired, it actually doesn't much matter whether all of your data is cached locally, sync'd to the cloud or whatever. The cloud is at it's best when you're risking data loss, or on the road without access to local storage. But most of the time users are merely trying to get things done--and that's why Windows Phone has stumbled even as more users move to smartphones and cloud services. It doesn't allow app developers to position their programs as links in a longer chain of actions.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m a Microsoft employee so you should apply the necessary filters to what I’m about to say, but here goes. With Windows 8 on multiple tablets and laptops, and a Windows phone, and Office apps that run full-strength when they can and in the browser when they can’t, and SkyDrive syncing everywhere, and a People hub that unites all my email and Facebook and Twitter and Skype contacts across my cloud of devices and services, I’m a happy camper. If all you’ve heard about Windows 8 is complaints about the start screen then you’re missing the real story. It’s an operating system that thinks rather deeply about the personal cloud and works hard to make it real.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>That this is Windows' limiting factor is evident enough from the comments you'll find on stories like this <a href="http://" target="_blank"></a>: The people who are most supportive of Windows Phone are often users with basic computing needs and no motivation to string apps together into workflows.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm not a very heavy App <em>[sic]</em> user (I stick mostly to texting, surfing the web, and web apps if necessary) so I'm more focused on the hardware. My Lumia 920 is amazing for me. It's really durable, I love the bright red color, and the screen is beautiful. The camera is nice too, but it's only useful when I have to take a picture of text since I don't take many pictures otherwise. I've had no issues since I switched, personally. That said, it makes me sad how little support WP8 gets.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another misconception is that normal users are confused or preoccupied by the fact that files in the cloud end up stored redundantly. Indeed, many documents I save in Dropbox also get saved to iCloud when I edit them there--things didn't use to work that way. But actually, this redundancy is more like a fringe benefit--more copies mean it's easier to find things and harder to lose them--and the idea that something is stored remotely isn't a hard concept. Plus, simply not losing things is a step up from the local storage paradigm. So why are users not more clearly enthusiastic about migrating all their stuff into the cloud?</p>

<blockquote><p>The Web teaches us this way of thinking. But we don’t easily learn it. I think a lot about reasons why not. A major one, I’ve concluded, is that we bring millions of years of primate evolution to our experience of the Web. In the physical world that was our only home until a few decades ago, objects were singular and lived in only one place. They weren’t easy to replicate, and they couldn’t form clouds of linked replicas. In the virtual world this magic seems to happen naturally, the effects are surprising, and it’s going to take us a while to get used to them.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It's intuitive that an app should retain content it edits, rather than storing it in some hierarchy. What's confusing for users is that a single file today, when accessed on mobile and desktop devices, often needs to be modified by several different apps in the course of a workflow. This is a far cry from the desktop software paradigm, where file formats were more proprietary, and all the actions available on that file were right there in the program that created it. To be useful and user-friendly, an app really needs to focus as much on features as the way it interacts with other apps.</p>
