<p>Publishers will be frightened to hear that Facebook is the new home of grammar--and any Facebook developer will tell you so. Spend some time building a Facebook app (or perhaps now, <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226513" target="_blank">a Parse app</a>) and you're presented with the Facebook App Dashboard, which is essentially a dynamic mad-lib generator with a few different inputs.</p>

<p>But yesterday Facebook announced that its semantic efforts are much more ambitious than perhaps anyone previously thought, forcing us to consider the idea of machine-written and machine-interpreted language as a part of our normal, everyday conversations, many of which happen (these days) on Facebook.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the kind of "language" Facebook speaks today, you can see it has a kindergartner's command of English from the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/overview/" target="_blank">Open Graph overview</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The actor: This is the person who published the story; The app: This is the app that publishes the story on the actor's behalf. Every story is generated by an app and every story includes the app used to create it; The action: This is the activity the actor performs, in our case 'finished reading'; The object: This is the object the actor interacts with, 'The Name of the Wind', a book.</p></blockquote>

<p>Developers can create custom subjects, objects and verbs, too:</p>

<blockquote><p>Objects are publicly accessible web pages hosted on the Internet, and almost any web page can be an object. Objects are public information. If there is no common action available that meets your needs, you can create your own custom action type. For example, if you're building an app to track rock climbing you may want to make an action 'climb' where the object is a mountain.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Facebook learned to be a little more linguistically flexible, there's no reason it couldn't write status updates for you, publish blog posts about trips you've taken, or compile other summary/analysis writing based on passive feedback from other apps that are connected to Facebook. This is Facebook becoming your personal narrator and scribe.</p>

<p>It's all explained in a 2,700-word technical post Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-the-natural-language-interface-of-graph-search/10151432733048920" target="_blank">published yesterday</a> about the lexical analysis built into its new Graph Search engine. It's no surprise that, as Facebook teaches itself to speak using intelligible statements, it might also learn how to read what people are writing. But this sort of lexical analysis is much more powerful than Facebook is letting on, because it allows Facebook to associate nodes on their network with a potentially unlimited number of sobriquets--making the computer better at understanding what you're talking about with little or no context.</p>

<p>Semantic understanding without context is most vital in search, and especially on mobile search, so this area of Facebook research should be no surprise given that <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007948/how-facebook-home-and-isnt-os" target="_self">Facebook Home is probably a nascent attempt at grabbing smartphone OS marketshare</a>. But semantic technology doesn't have to be restricted to tasks like search; in fact, this sort of lexical analysis makes it easier for the page to "listen in" on the topic being discussed on the page, serve targeted ads, or spawn calls to action (the way Facebook reminds you to hit up old friends.) From Facebook's post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our team realized very early on that to be useful, the grammar should also allow users to express their intent in many various ways. For example, a user can search for photos of his friends by typing:

<p>“photos of my friends”<br />
“friend photos”<br />
“photos with my friends”<br />
“pictures of my friends”<br />
“photos of facebook friends”</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Facebook has also taught the system to compensate for subject-verb agreement errors and other common grammatical mistakes. But where things get even more portentous for publishers is when it comes to Graph Search's focus on synonyms, dialects and slang:</p>

<blockquote><p>The challenge for the team was to make sure that any reasonable user input produces plausible suggestions using Graph Search… The team gathered long lists of synonyms that we felt could be used interchangeably. Using synonyms, one can search for “besties from my hood” and get the same results as if he had searched for “my friends from my hometown.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If you think that the way people talk on the web will be impossible for machines to ever comprehend, think again. Facebook says it is trying to make Graph Search useful even for incredibly vague, poorly-worded queries using some incredibly clever parsing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our grammar only covers a small subspace of what a user can potentially search for. There are queries that cannot be precisely answered by our system at this time but can be approximated by certain forms generated from the grammar. For example, “all my friends photos” -&gt; My friends’ photos… In order for our grammar to focus on the most important parts of what a user types, the team built list of words that can be optionalized in certain context: “all” can be ignored when it appears before ahead noun as in “all photos”, but shouldn’t be ignored in other context such as “friends of all” (which could be auto completed to “friends of Allen” and thus shouldn’t be optionalized).</p></blockquote>

<p>Facebook is building on some pre-existing technologies here, to help handle some of these unpredictable queries using abstract associations:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our team used <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu" target="_blank">WordNet</a> toextract related word forms to let users search for people with similar interests in very simple queries “surfers in los angeles” or “quilters nearby" … In Graph Search, we use a variation of the N-shortest path algorithm, an extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm, to solve the problem of finding the top K best parse trees. Our biggest challenge was to find several heuristics that allow us to speed up the computation of the top K grammar suggestions, thereby providing a real-timee xperience to our users.</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, Facebook has even taught its system to understand and ignore oxymorons:</p>

<blockquote><p>A naïve, context-free grammar would allow the production of a wide range of sentences, some of which can be syntactically correct but not semantically meaningful. For example, Non-friends who are my friends; Females who live in San Francisco and are males; Both sentences would return empty sets of results because they each carry contradictory semantics. It is therefore critical for our parser to be able to understand semantics with opposite meanings in order to return plausible suggestions to users.</p></blockquote>

<h4><a name="Why_Were_Tracking_This_Story">Why We're Tracking This Story</a></h4>

<p>Chicken Little says journalism is dying. Well, there are certainly many struggling journals, especially among those that came of age before the Internet. Ask a publisher where the big bucks went, and they're likely to mumble something about Craigslist, the loss of print advertising dollars, and an inability to sustain a newsroom with digital advertising.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Matthew Yglesias writing for Slate Magazine says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/03/pew_s_state_of_the_media_ignore_the_doomsaying_american_journalism_has_never.html" target="_blank">ignore the doomsayers: The news-reading public has never had more and better information at their fingertips</a>. Thanks to social networks and ubiquitous mobile Internet, anyone can report from anywhere in the world at any time. As a result, more news is available on more subjects than at any previous time in history.</p>

<p>If you ask me, this is the real cause of publishers’ struggles. Many of the functions they used to perform are simply no longer valuable in a world where everybody, and increasingly nobody in the form of automated sensor networks, can report basic information.</p>

<p>Worse still, news organizations by and large missed the boat on Internet technology and are only now starting to catch up, just as an increasing number of new technology companies set their sights on replacing even more functions that journalists used to perform exclusively.</p>

<p>So what value can news organizations provide in order to survive? Fortunately, there’s no shortage of opinion from academics, technologists, and journalists themselves. This is my attempt to track those ongoing conversations and add my thoughts as both a technologist and a journalist.</p>

<hr />

<h3><a name="Previous_Updates">Previous Updates</a></h3>

<p><strong>Today, anyone can report new information and watch it spread through their social network, sometimes reaching millions, without the intervention of a professional journalist.</strong> In the days before Twitter, disseminating breaking news took time. To reach a meaningful audience, information had to pass through a series of reporters and editors en route to a television screen or page in a newspaper.</p>

<p>This example of technology replacing a classic journalistic function is a direct threat to the livelihood of many news organizations who once made their names by being the first to every story. To adjust, outlets like CNN and the Associated Press have joined the Twitter rat race and adjusted editorial processes on other mediums to move quicker. But in a world where everyone knows about breaking news almost instantaneously, the rush to be first can cause more problems for news organizations than it solves.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the Boston Marathon bombings. After the explosions, information spread like wildfire. Some of it was false, as is always the case in a breaking news situation, but instead of acting with restraint, many news organizations <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/boston-marathon-tragedy-exposes-twitters-reporting-flaws_b18546" target="_blank">rushed to report falsehoods and speculations</a> as fact. For example, CNN reporting that suspects had been arrested on Wednesday night, or the <em>New York Post</em> clinging to a rumor that 12 people died in the explosions, or everybody and their mother reporting that the government had cut off cell phone service in Boston to prevent further remote detonations.</p>

<p>Ironically, we’re talking about this issue because despite the democratization of news, journalists still hold real power. Twitter accounts like <a href="http://twitter.com/ap" target="_blank">@AP</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cnnbrk" target="_blank">@CNNBRK</a> have millions of followers who trust them to report accurately. If you need evidence of that, look no further than when a hacker broke into the AP’s Twitter account and sent a fake tweet that caused automated stock traders to momentarily <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/04/24/dow-jones-drops-but-recovers-after-fake-ap-tweet/" target="_blank">send the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 143 points</a>.</p>

<p><em>Circa</em> editor-in-chief Dave Cohn <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/3aca5a9e6f89" target="_blank">called it an inevitable product of newsrooms trying to be first</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have the unstoppable force of news organizations that want to be first and want as much attention as possible, especially in times of breaking news. On the other hand we also have the immovable object of technology platforms like Twitter that will inevitably be where news breaks and where people flock to get information, especially when there is breaking news.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like this description because it correctly summarizes the conflict between two fields converging, but I wonder if news organizations need to be unstoppable. In the wake of both events, several future of news pundits called for journalists to stop trying to be first and instead find other ways to compete with social networks.</p>

<p>Here’s CUNY Professor Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/04/22/and-now-the-news-heres-what-we-dont-know-at-this-hour/" target="_blank">on an alternative model</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key skill of journalism today is saying what we *don’t* know, issuing caveats and also inviting the public to tell us what they know<br />
...<br />
If I ran a news organization, I would start a regular feature called, Here’s what you should know about what you’re hearing elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Mike Annany <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/breaking-news-pragmatically-some-reflections-on-silence-and-timing-in-networked-journalism/" target="_blank">wrote about silence and timing for the Nieman Lab</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Internet makes it possible for people other than traditional journalists to express themselves, quickly, to potentially large audiences. But the ideal press should be about more than this. It should be about demonstrating robust answers to two inseparable questions: Why do you need to know something now? And why do you need to say something now?</p></blockquote>

<p>Both of these authors make the same basic argument: There are ways to add value to news consumers without sacrificing accuracy by always trying to be first. This idea is compelling, but for news organizations worrying about disappearing bottom lines, Dan Gillmor’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/23/ap-twitter-hack-hoax-digital-media" target="_blank">argument in the <em>Guardian</em></a> ought to resonate more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Information providers forfeit some trust every time they make mistakes. That eventually, one hopes, affects the bottom line, or in a social context, the confidence of one's friends and peers.</p></blockquote>

<p>In an environment where trust is just about all they have left, perhaps publishers would be wise to rethink whether speed or accuracy is more valuable to the consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The decline in value isn't limited to consumers.</strong> Newspaper and magazine publishers used to serve a vital function for advertisers as well. Before the Internet, print publications were one of the few places advertisers, especially local ones, could reach large, wealthy audiences. This gave publishers total control over pricing, making print advertising an extremely profitable business.</p>

<p>Today, no single website has a monopoly on any audience. If advertisers want to reach <em>New York Times</em> readers, they can do so on a variety of similar websites just as easily as they can on the Grey Lady’s site. Not only that, but advertisers now know more about these audiences than ever before. They can tell exactly how many users see ads, whether they click or engage on them, even target individual users based on past interactions. As a result, control over pricing has been flipped on its head. If your prices are too expensive, an advertiser can go elsewhere and reach the same exact people.</p>

<p>How are publishing companies coping? They’re rethinking the value they offer to advertisers.</p>

<p>One approach is to sell so-called “native advertising,” which publications like <em>The Atlantic</em> and Buzzfeed are pursuing with a decent amount of success. The thinking goes something like this:</p>

<p>“The real value we offer isn't the audience on its own, it's our ability to produce content that our audience wants to read. We can sell that expertise to advertisers.”</p>

<p>When this tactic works, the result is content that consumers want to read, share, and interact with at much higher rates than traditional banner ads. This means organizations can charge more and, because the content is tailored specifically to the site it runs on, publishers regain some of the audience exclusivity they could claim in print.</p>

<p>When it backfires, however, the result can be disastrous for the organization’s credibility. Such was the case when <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/on-the-atlantics-scientology-ad-and-aftermath/273447/" target="_blank">published an advertisement</a> celebrating the Church of Scientology that felt completely at odds with the publication’s core value of intellectual integrity.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Thanks to the Internet, most of the wealth of human knowledge is instantly and freely available.</strong> That’s tough luck for businesses that used to make money by charging for access to information, but it’s not stopping some publishers from taking a gamble that their stuff is still worth paying for.</p>

<p>High-profile publishers like the <em>New York Times</em> have put up paywalls that require readers to pay for unlimited access to their websites, with some success. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/business/media/times-company-reports-a-drop-in-income.html" target="_blank">The <em>Times</em> announced</a> that while ad revenue decreased by 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2013, subscription revenues increased 6.5 percent.</p>

<p>The tactic isn’t a panacea, however. <em>USA Today</em> publisher Larry Kramer infamously told the world his newspaper’s content “<a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/usa-today-publisher-larry-kramer-were-not-unique-enough-charge-web-access-66791" target="_blank">wasn’t unique enough</a>” to charge customers for its content. He’s probably right. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, but research by University of Missouri Journalism Dean Esther Thorson <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/the-newsonomics-of-pulitzers-paywalls-and-investing-in-the-newsroom/" target="_blank">has found a direct link</a> between newsroom investment and paywall success:</p>

<blockquote><p>Input into the newsroom in dollars had far and away the greatest impact on all sources of revenues -- both advertising and circulation.</p></blockquote>

<p>This leads me to a most obvious takeaway: If you want readers to value your content enough to pay for it, you should probably value it at least that much, too.</p>
