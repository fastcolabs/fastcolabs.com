<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://gittip.com" target="_blank">Gittip</a> founder Chad Whitacre declined to be interviewed by Tech Crunch unless he could record and publish the full, unedited conversation online. His reasoning? Gittip is an open company (in fact, it inspired payments startup Balanced, <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008944/open-company/why-i-made-my-payments-startup-an-open-company" target="_self">which we recently profiled</a>), and he tries to do as many things out in the open as possible. Tech Crunch declined, and Whitacre <a href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/5886749a4ded" target="_blank">wrote about the experience on Medium</a>. His main point is that he thinks making all interviews open provides more value for everyone than keeping them closed just so one publication can claim a scoop:</p>

<blockquote><p>To me, that looks like it exposes journalism as a zero-sum game, and I don’t play zero-sum games, if I can help it. In my worldview, having multiple journalists conducting interviews and having multiple journalists writing stories based on those interviews is an overall win for readers and for humanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>He’s right. As I’ve written before, in a world where anyone can break news and spread it around the world in seconds simply by tweeting, being first to a story isn’t very valuable. Publications like Tech Crunch try to artificially create value by demanding startups give them exclusive stories, but this tactic will become increasingly less effective as companies and individuals find ways to reach large audiences without these publications.</p>

<p>Companies have good reason to go around places like Tech Crunch. After posting his thoughts on Medium, two journalists took him up on his offer for an open interview: Brian Jackson of ITBusiness.ca, and Mathew Ingram of Paid Content.  In the interview with Ingram, which I live-tweeted for reasons I’ll discuss in a moment, Whitacre explained why he was comfortable offering Tech Crunch something they would likely turn down:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Tech Crunch is a machine. How many stories of new startups are they stamping out every day? What value is it to me, building my company, to be just one of another stream of stories that floats by on Tech Crunch?”</p></blockquote>

<figure class="inline-video inline"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5rb5qGsYat4?rel=1&amp;autoplay=0" width="631" height="380" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>

<p>In this way, an open interview functions as protection from gatekeepers like Tech Crunch that provide artificial value. This view is understandable given Tech Crunch’s recent reputation for being <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2011/09/06/techcrunch-and-crunchfund-the-conflict-of-interest-controversy/" target="_blank">unstable and full of conflicts of interest</a>. But by trying to protect himself from places like Tech Crunch, Whitacre also limits the coverage he’ll see from journalists trying to provide their audiences with more value than just a scoop.</p>

<p>In the interview with Ingram, Whitacre equates journalists synthesizing raw information into understandable stories with engineers creating easier-to-use abstractions from more complicated systems. This is a great metaphor, except that interview material isn’t analogous to a preexisting underlying system. Professional journalists use interviews to extract value that wasn’t there before. Otherwise, why not just interview yourself and post for all to see? <em>(Ed. note: that’s called a press release.)</em></p>

<p>That’s why journalists rightfully feel a sense of ownership over their interviews. It’s one thing if all you’re doing is grabbing a few extra quotes to footnote a press release. It’s another if you’re trying to tell a complex, in-depth story like the piece Co.Labs editor Chris Dannen <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3002676/open-company/magical-tech-behind-paper-ipads-color-mixing-perfection" target="_self">wrote about iPad app Paper</a>.</p>

<p>Writing that story took dozens of hours of interviewing, transcribing, assembling, writing and editing. If we had live-broadcast these interviews as they happened, publications could have collected and posted all of the best bits with their own framing. This would have made it nearly impossible to write a new and valuable story because Chris would have had to compete with himself keep up with competitors’ efforts. It would be analogous to releasing only the back-end for a web app and having other developers gain traction with their own front-ends before you have a chance to launch yours.</p>

<p>If you believe that professional journalists create value by interviewing, there’s one other problem with open interviews. If you watch a few of the open calls on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pn9TqF9v1o&amp;amp;list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT" target="_blank">Whitacre’s Youtube channel</a>, you’ll notice that they’re fairly performative. Whitacre in particular seems to have mastered an informal but polished style that suits him well.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that I live-tweeted the interview as it happened. One of the reasons I did this was to see how both parties behaved, knowing for certain that they were being watched (by a journalist, no less). During the interview, Ingram admitted that he was “conscious of my questions because I don’t want to look like an idiot when someone watches our interview,” to which Whitacre responded that he would get used to it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of tech personalities who are good at manipulating the press via performance (a certain former Apple CEO comes to mind, for instance). One of the nice things about a private interview is that people often stop performing when they know that they can take statements off the record if they need to. Similarly, as a journalist you can try ways of getting answers that don’t necessarily come off as smart or polite without worrying about what people will think of you.</p>

<figure class="inline-video inline"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Pn9TqF9v1o?rel=1&amp;autoplay=0" width="631" height="380" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>

<p>Don’t believe that’s a big deal? Not to pick on a fellow journalist, but I wonder if Jackson would like to have this exchange from his interview with Whitacre back:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jackson: “Actually I was just thinking that other writers could watch this and write the story for me.”<br />
Whitacre: “So did you even see that somebody already tweeted that?”<br />
Jackson: “Yeah I did, I was talking to that guy. I’m kidding. I will write this.”<br />
Whitacre: “It’s up to you, right?”<br />
Jackson: “It would be funny, though, if I was too lazy to write it myself I just do the interview and then I’m like ‘oh, well, this guy wrote it up for me.’”<br />
Whitacre: “It’s open-source journalism, it’s fascinating.”<br />
Jackson: “Why not? Saves me the time. I’ll go write a different story, right?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe he'd like to tell me in an open interview of his own?</p>

<h4><a name="Why_Were_Tracking_This_Story">Why We're Tracking This Story</a></h4>

<p>Chicken Little says journalism is dying. Well, there are certainly many struggling journals, especially among those that came of age before the Internet. Ask a publisher where the big bucks went, and they're likely to mumble something about Craigslist, the loss of print advertising dollars, and an inability to sustain a newsroom with digital advertising.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Matthew Yglesias writing for Slate Magazine says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/03/pew_s_state_of_the_media_ignore_the_doomsaying_american_journalism_has_never.html" target="_blank">ignore the doomsayers: The news-reading public has never had more and better information at their fingertips</a>. Thanks to social networks and ubiquitous mobile Internet, anyone can report from anywhere in the world at any time. As a result, more news is available on more subjects than at any previous time in history.</p>

<p>If you ask me, this is the real cause of publishers’ struggles. Many of the functions they used to perform are simply no longer valuable in a world where everybody, and increasingly nobody in the form of automated sensor networks, can report basic information.</p>

<p>Worse still, news organizations by and large missed the boat on Internet technology and are only now starting to catch up, just as an increasing number of new technology companies set their sights on replacing even more functions that journalists used to perform exclusively.</p>

<p>So what value can news organizations provide in order to survive? Fortunately, there’s no shortage of opinion from academics, technologists, and journalists themselves. This is my attempt to track those ongoing conversations and add my thoughts as both a technologist and a journalist.</p>

<hr />

<p>Stay tuned as we continue to track future of publishing and content in this story.</p>

<h3><a name="Previous_Updates">Previous Updates</a></h3></p>

<p><strong>Publishing first means breaking news--and maybe battering your own reputation.</strong> Because of the chaos of events like the Boston bombing, media outlets like the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/04/22/young-men-please-sue-the-new-york-post/" target="_blank"><em>New York Post</em></a> and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/19/reddit-boston-marathon-crowdsourcing" target="_blank">crowdsourced “FindBostonBombers” campaign on Reddit</a> routinely identify the wrong suspects--and push reports to the public.</p>

<p>During emergencies like Hurricane Sandy or the 2011 London riots, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/07/how-twitter-spread-rumours-riots" target="_blank">false rumours and fake photos</a> abounded on social networks like Twitter. When even professional journalists get it wrong, how can you tell fact from fiction and ensure that you are not sharing false information yourself? Do your own digital fact checking.</p>

<p>Claire Wardle is the <a href="http://storyful.com/Claire_Wardle/22242" target="_blank">Director of News Services</a> at <a href="http://storyful.com/" target="_blank">Storyful</a>, a startup founded by veteran Irish journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Little_%28Irish_journalist%29" target="_blank">Mark Little</a>, which verifies social media content like YouTube videos for news organizations. “Lots of people were sharing stuff around Hurricane Sandy which was fake. It would have taken them two seconds to do a <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html" target="_blank">reverse image search</a>,” she says. ”After the recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-helicopter-crash" target="_blank">helicopter crash in London</a>, the Guardian had an image up for 2 hours purporting to be of the crash which wasn't verified.” Storyful’s verification process combines tech tools and old-fashioned journalistic skills as described in a recent blog post on <a href="http://blog.storyful.com/2013/04/16/finding-facts-in-the-heat-of-the-moment/" target="_blank">how the company verified a video</a> taken during the Boston marathon bombings.</p>

<p>Reverse image search tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html" target="_blank">Google Search by Image</a> and <a href="http://www.tineye.com/" target="_blank">TinEye</a> return where an image appears online and therefore help you to track its original source and history. For example, during the London riots in 2011, there was a rumour circulating on Twitter that tigers had been released from London Zoo, including a <a href="http://twitter.yfrog.com/h0vy4gsdj?sa=0" target="_blank">photo of a big cat on a city street</a>. The photo turned out to be of a big cat which escaped from a circus in Italy in 2008.</p>

<p>Also during the London riots Twitter users circulated a photoshopped <a href="http://fallenscoop.com/18503/terrifying-image-of-the-london-eye-on-fire-is-believed-to-be-a-fake-hoax" target="_blank">image of the London Eye on fire</a>. FourMatch is a paid image forensics tool ($20 buys you a demo key to analyze up to 30 images within 30 days) which can detect whether or not an image has been tampered with. TinEye also sorts results by how much an image has been modified.</p>

<p>When looking at video, Storyful tries to match the location where the video was purportedly filmed with the real location using tools like Google maps and Streetview. <a href="http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;amp;lat=40.728000&amp;amp;lon=-73.945300&amp;amp;z=10&amp;amp;m=b" target="_blank">Wikimapia</a>, Wikipedia for maps, is useful for identifying districts or buildings which appear on commercial map services like Google Maps. <a href="http://www.maplandia.com/" target="_blank">Maplandia</a> has some similar features. <a href="http://corp.geofeedia.com/" target="_blank">Geofedia’s</a> location-based social media search can <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/173764/geofeedia-helps-journalists-locate-real-time-photos-tweets-where-news-breaks/" target="_blank">help to determine</a> if an image or video was actually sent from a given location.</p>

<p>Finally, Storyful checks the social media profiles from which images and video originated and links them to people. Use <a href="http://www.domaintools.com/" target="_blank">DomainTools</a> to check domain ownership and <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/" target="_blank">Spokeo People Search</a> or <a href="http://www.whitepages.com/" target="_blank">Whitepages</a> to find information about people in the U.S. in particular.</p>

<p>What if you want to make it easier for images or video you capture yourself to be verified? Wardle’s first piece of advice is to <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/173764/geofeedia-helps-journalists-locate-real-time-photos-tweets-where-news-breaks/" target="_blank">geotag</a> it. Only a tiny proportion of social media content is currently geotagged. ”<a href="http://www.witness.org/" target="_blank">Witness</a> (a non-profit which highlights human rights abuses) has two pieces of technology: <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2012/01/20/introducing-informacam/" target="_blank">Informacam</a> and <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/" target="_blank">Obscuracam</a>. Obscuracam hides all metadata like location, is specifically for activists who want to give verification information.” The metadata includes information like the user’s current GPS coordinates, altitude, compass bearing, light meter readings, the signatures of neighboring devices, cell towers, and Wi-Fi networks. <br />
 	 	 	<br />
“The behavior of the people on the ground is changing,” adds Storyful founder Mark Little. “The activist will point the camera at a minaret before going back to the focus of their story. The general public will start to realise that they should geotag their tweet if they want it to be seen. The motivated crowd will become much more literate in helping us help them.”</p>

<p>If you realize that you have distributed false information on Twitter, one enterprising developer has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/retwact-a-tool-for-fixing-twitters-misinformation-problem/275418/" target="_blank">created a tool called Retwact</a>, which lets you issue a correction or apology. Followers can view a side-by-side comparison showing both the older, incorrect tweet as well as the newer, corrected one.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Today Reuters <a href="http://preview.reuters.com/" target="_blank">launched a preview</a> of its next-generation web platform.</strong> Called Reuter’s Next, it’s a massive improvement over its legacy site for many reasons. It uses cutting edge technology, which Reuters Tech Editor Paul Smalera <a href="https://twitter.com/smalera/statuses/329317106640371713" target="_blank">took to Twitter</a> to brag about at length two days ago.</p>

<p>The site also adopts a design and presentation concept that’s becoming popular online called “river of news.” The idea is that because users often come into a single article on your website rather than your homepage, every article page should be filled with content, like a homepage. The Atlantic’s business-focused sister site, <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, is a pioneer of this concept.</p>

<p>Reuters is taking the concept a step further by treating visits to an article as a signal that a reader is interested in a particular topic. When you click on an article about Facebook, the site will search its database using a new deep tagging system and surround the story with links to other articles about Facebook. In an <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/05/every-page-is-your-homepage-reuters-untied-to-print-metaphor-builds-a-modern-river-of-news/" target="_blank">interview with Nieman Labs’ Justin Ellis</a>, Reuters Head of Product Alex Leo said their goal is to help readers fully understand the subject of the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>“We wanted to create an experience for users that would give them the right amount of breadth and knowledge that they need from Reuters.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This sentiment hits right at home for us, because one of the goals of our Co.Labs Tracking stories (you’re reading one right now) is to provide you with a choice: If you’re already familiar with the story, you can stop reading after this update. If you’re new to it and want more information, all you have to do is scroll down. We don’t assume either.</p>

<p>Reuters’ new site is a great first step, but there’s one problem: Even as the website tries to be helpful by giving you context if you want it, every article is still a traditional 800-word news article with a structure that assumes you’re new to the issue. If you want to get all of the new information out of it, you have to read through the entire article, background paragraphs and all.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, content is still the main reason people visit a news website. Adding context as an additional service Reuters provides to the reader is great, but the 100-year-old article format makes it far less valuable than it could be. We’d like Reuters continue to experiment--not just with its website, but with its content.</p>

<p>Publishers will be frightened to hear that Facebook is the new home of grammar--and any Facebook developer will tell you so. Spend some time building a Facebook app (or perhaps now, <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226513" target="_blank">a Parse app</a>) and you're presented with the Facebook App Dashboard, which is essentially a dynamic mad-lib generator with a few different inputs.</p>

<p>But yesterday Facebook announced that its semantic efforts are much more ambitious than perhaps anyone previously thought, forcing us to consider the idea of machine-written and machine-interpreted language as a part of our normal, everyday conversations, many of which happen (these days) on Facebook.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the kind of "language" Facebook speaks today, you can see it has a kindergartner's command of English from the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/overview/" target="_blank">Open Graph overview</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The actor: This is the person who published the story; The app: This is the app that publishes the story on the actor's behalf. Every story is generated by an app and every story includes the app used to create it; The action: This is the activity the actor performs, in our case 'finished reading'; The object: This is the object the actor interacts with, 'The Name of the Wind', a book.</p></blockquote>

<p>Developers can create custom subjects, objects and verbs, too:</p>

<blockquote><p>Objects are publicly accessible web pages hosted on the Internet, and almost any web page can be an object. Objects are public information. If there is no common action available that meets your needs, you can create your own custom action type. For example, if you're building an app to track rock climbing you may want to make an action 'climb' where the object is a mountain.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Facebook learned to be a little more linguistically flexible, there's no reason it couldn't write status updates for you, publish blog posts about trips you've taken, or compile other summary/analysis writing based on passive feedback from other apps that are connected to Facebook. This is Facebook becoming your personal narrator and scribe.</p>

<p>It's all explained in a 2,700-word technical post Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-the-natural-language-interface-of-graph-search/10151432733048920" target="_blank">published yesterday</a> about the lexical analysis built into its new Graph Search engine. It's no surprise that, as Facebook teaches itself to speak using intelligible statements, it might also learn how to read what people are writing. But this sort of lexical analysis is much more powerful than Facebook is letting on, because it allows Facebook to associate nodes on their network with a potentially unlimited number of sobriquets--making the computer better at understanding what you're talking about with little or no context.</p>

<p>Semantic understanding without context is most vital in search, and especially on mobile search, so this area of Facebook research should be no surprise given that <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007948/how-facebook-home-and-isnt-os" target="_self">Facebook Home is probably a nascent attempt at grabbing smartphone OS marketshare</a>. But semantic technology doesn't have to be restricted to tasks like search; in fact, this sort of lexical analysis makes it easier for the page to "listen in" on the topic being discussed on the page, serve targeted ads, or spawn calls to action (the way Facebook reminds you to hit up old friends). From Facebook's post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our team realized very early on that to be useful, the grammar should also allow users to express their intent in many various ways. For example, a user can search for photos of his friends by typing:

<p>“photos of my friends”<br />
“friend photos”<br />
“photos with my friends”<br />
“pictures of my friends”<br />
“photos of facebook friends”</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Facebook has also taught the system to compensate for subject-verb agreement errors and other common grammatical mistakes. But where things get even more portentous for publishers is when it comes to Graph Search's focus on synonyms, dialects, and slang:</p>

<blockquote><p>The challenge for the team was to make sure that any reasonable user input produces plausible suggestions using Graph Search… The team gathered long lists of synonyms that we felt could be used interchangeably. Using synonyms, one can search for “besties from my hood” and get the same results as if he had searched for “my friends from my hometown.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If you think that the way people talk on the web will be impossible for machines to ever comprehend, think again. Facebook says it is trying to make Graph Search useful even for incredibly vague, poorly worded queries using some incredibly clever parsing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our grammar only covers a small subspace of what a user can potentially search for. There are queries that cannot be precisely answered by our system at this time but can be approximated by certain forms generated from the grammar. For example, “all my friends photos” -&gt; My friends’ photos… In order for our grammar to focus on the most important parts of what a user types, the team built list of words that can be optionalized in certain context: “all” can be ignored when it appears before ahead noun as in “all photos”, but shouldn’t be ignored in other context such as “friends of all” (which could be auto completed to “friends of Allen” and thus shouldn’t be optionalized).</p></blockquote>

<p>Facebook is building on some pre-existing technologies here, to help handle some of these unpredictable queries using abstract associations:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our team used <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu" target="_blank">WordNet</a> to extract related word forms to let users search for people with similar interests in very simple queries “surfers in los angeles” or “quilters nearby" … In Graph Search, we use a variation of the N-shortest path algorithm, an extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm, to solve the problem of finding the top K best parse trees. Our biggest challenge was to find several heuristics that allow us to speed up the computation of the top K grammar suggestions, thereby providing a real-time xperience to our users.</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, Facebook has even taught its system to understand and ignore oxymorons:</p>

<blockquote><p>A naïve, context-free grammar would allow the production of a wide range of sentences, some of which can be syntactically correct but not semantically meaningful. For example, Non-friends who are my friends; Females who live in San Francisco and are males; Both sentences would return empty sets of results because they each carry contradictory semantics. It is therefore critical for our parser to be able to understand semantics with opposite meanings in order to return plausible suggestions to users.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p><strong>Today, anyone can report new information and watch it spread through their social network, sometimes reaching millions, without the intervention of a professional journalist.</strong> In the days before Twitter, disseminating breaking news took time. To reach a meaningful audience, information had to pass through a series of reporters and editors en route to a television screen or page in a newspaper.</p>

<p>This example of technology replacing a classic journalistic function is a direct threat to the livelihood of many news organizations who once made their names by being the first to every story. To adjust, outlets like CNN and the Associated Press have joined the Twitter rat race and adjusted editorial processes on other mediums to move quicker. But in a world where everyone knows about breaking news almost instantaneously, the rush to be first can cause more problems for news organizations than it solves.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the Boston Marathon bombings. After the explosions, information spread like wildfire. Some of it was false, as is always the case in a breaking news situation, but instead of acting with restraint, many news organizations <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/boston-marathon-tragedy-exposes-twitters-reporting-flaws_b18546" target="_blank">rushed to report falsehoods and speculations</a> as fact. For example, CNN reporting that suspects had been arrested on Wednesday night, or the <em>New York Post</em> clinging to a rumor that 12 people died in the explosions, or everybody and their mother reporting that the government had cut off cell phone service in Boston to prevent further remote detonations.</p>

<p>Ironically, we’re talking about this issue because despite the democratization of news, journalists still hold real power. Twitter accounts like <a href="http://twitter.com/ap" target="_blank">@AP</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cnnbrk" target="_blank">@CNNBRK</a> have millions of followers who trust them to report accurately. If you need evidence of that, look no further than when a hacker broke into the AP’s Twitter account and sent a fake tweet that caused automated stock traders to momentarily <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/04/24/dow-jones-drops-but-recovers-after-fake-ap-tweet/" target="_blank">send the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 143 points</a>.</p>

<p><em>Circa</em> editor-in-chief Dave Cohn <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/3aca5a9e6f89" target="_blank">called it an inevitable product of newsrooms trying to be first</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have the unstoppable force of news organizations that want to be first and want as much attention as possible, especially in times of breaking news. On the other hand we also have the immovable object of technology platforms like Twitter that will inevitably be where news breaks and where people flock to get information, especially when there is breaking news.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like this description because it correctly summarizes the conflict between two fields converging, but I wonder if news organizations need to be unstoppable. In the wake of both events, several future of news pundits called for journalists to stop trying to be first and instead find other ways to compete with social networks.</p>

<p>Here’s CUNY Professor Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/04/22/and-now-the-news-heres-what-we-dont-know-at-this-hour/" target="_blank">on an alternative model</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key skill of journalism today is saying what we *don’t* know, issuing caveats and also inviting the public to tell us what they know<br />
...<br />
If I ran a news organization, I would start a regular feature called, Here’s what you should know about what you’re hearing elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Mike Annany <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/breaking-news-pragmatically-some-reflections-on-silence-and-timing-in-networked-journalism/" target="_blank">wrote about silence and timing for the Nieman Lab</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Internet makes it possible for people other than traditional journalists to express themselves, quickly, to potentially large audiences. But the ideal press should be about more than this. It should be about demonstrating robust answers to two inseparable questions: Why do you need to know something now? And why do you need to say something now?</p></blockquote>

<p>Both of these authors make the same basic argument: There are ways to add value to news consumers without sacrificing accuracy by always trying to be first. This idea is compelling, but for news organizations worrying about disappearing bottom lines, Dan Gillmor’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/23/ap-twitter-hack-hoax-digital-media" target="_blank">argument in the <em>Guardian</em></a> ought to resonate more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Information providers forfeit some trust every time they make mistakes. That eventually, one hopes, affects the bottom line, or in a social context, the confidence of one's friends and peers.</p></blockquote>

<p>In an environment where trust is just about all they have left, perhaps publishers would be wise to rethink whether speed or accuracy is more valuable to the consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The decline in value isn't limited to consumers.</strong> Newspaper and magazine publishers used to serve a vital function for advertisers as well. Before the Internet, print publications were one of the few places advertisers, especially local ones, could reach large, wealthy audiences. This gave publishers total control over pricing, making print advertising an extremely profitable business.</p>

<p>Today, no single website has a monopoly on any audience. If advertisers want to reach <em>New York Times</em> readers, they can do so on a variety of similar websites just as easily as they can on the Grey Lady’s site. Not only that, but advertisers now know more about these audiences than ever before. They can tell exactly how many users see ads, whether they click or engage on them, even target individual users based on past interactions. As a result, control over pricing has been flipped on its head. If your prices are too expensive, an advertiser can go elsewhere and reach the same exact people.</p>

<p>How are publishing companies coping? They’re rethinking the value they offer to advertisers.</p>

<p>One approach is to sell so-called “native advertising,” which publications like <em>The Atlantic</em> and Buzzfeed are pursuing with a decent amount of success. The thinking goes something like this:</p>

<p>“The real value we offer isn't the audience on its own, it's our ability to produce content that our audience wants to read. We can sell that expertise to advertisers.”</p>

<p>When this tactic works, the result is content that consumers want to read, share, and interact with at much higher rates than traditional banner ads. This means organizations can charge more and, because the content is tailored specifically to the site it runs on, publishers regain some of the audience exclusivity they could claim in print.</p>

<p>When it backfires, however, the result can be disastrous for the organization’s credibility. Such was the case when <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/on-the-atlantics-scientology-ad-and-aftermath/273447/" target="_blank">published an advertisement</a> celebrating the Church of Scientology that felt completely at odds with the publication’s core value of intellectual integrity.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Thanks to the Internet, most of the wealth of human knowledge is instantly and freely available.</strong> That’s tough luck for businesses that used to make money by charging for access to information, but it’s not stopping some publishers from taking a gamble that their stuff is still worth paying for.</p>

<p>High-profile publishers like the <em>New York Times</em> have put up paywalls that require readers to pay for unlimited access to their websites, with some success. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/business/media/times-company-reports-a-drop-in-income.html" target="_blank">The <em>Times</em> announced</a> that while ad revenue decreased by 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2013, subscription revenues increased 6.5 percent.</p>

<p>The tactic isn’t a panacea, however. <em>USA Today</em> publisher Larry Kramer infamously told the world his newspaper’s content “<a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/usa-today-publisher-larry-kramer-were-not-unique-enough-charge-web-access-66791" target="_blank">wasn’t unique enough</a>” to charge customers for its content. He’s probably right. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, but research by University of Missouri Journalism Dean Esther Thorson <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/the-newsonomics-of-pulitzers-paywalls-and-investing-in-the-newsroom/" target="_blank">has found a direct link</a> between newsroom investment and paywall success:</p>

<blockquote><p>Input into the newsroom in dollars had far and away the greatest impact on all sources of revenues -- both advertising and circulation.</p></blockquote>

<p>This leads me to a most obvious takeaway: If you want readers to value your content enough to pay for it, you should probably value it at least that much, too.</p>
