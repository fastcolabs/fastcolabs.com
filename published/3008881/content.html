<p>Chicken Little says journalism is dying. Well, there are certainly many struggling journals, especially among those that came of age before the internet. Ask a publisher where the big bucks went, and they're likely to mumble something about Craigslist, the loss of print advertising dollars, and an inability to sustain a newsroom with digital advertising.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Matthew Yglesias writing for Slate Magazine says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/03/pew_s_state_of_the_media_ignore_the_doomsaying_american_journalism_has_never.html" target="_blank">Ignore the doomsayers: The news-reading public has never had more and better information at their fingertips</a>. Thanks to social networks and ubiquitous mobile internet, anyone can report from anywhere in the world at any time. As a result, more news is available on more subjects than at any previous time in history.</p>

<p>If you ask me, this is the real cause of publishers’ struggles. Many of the functions they used to perform are simply no longer valuable in a world where everybody, and increasingly nobody in the form of automated sensor networks, can report basic information.</p>

<p>Worse still, news organizations by and large missed the boat on internet technology and are only now starting to catch up, just as an increasing number of new technology companies set their sights on replacing even more functions that journalists used to perform exclusively.</p>

<p>So what value can news organizations provide in order to survive? Fortunately, there’s no shortage of opinion from academics, technologists and journalists themselves. This is my attempt to track those ongoing conversations and add my thoughts as both a technologist and a journalist.</p>

<h3><a name="Previous_Updates">Previous Updates</a></h3>

<p><strong>Today, anyone can report new information and watch it spread through their social network, sometimes reaching millions, without the intervention of a professional journalist.</strong> In the days before Twitter, disseminating breaking news took time. To reach a meaningful audience, information had to pass through a series of reporters and editors en route to a television screen or page in a newspaper.</p>

<p>This example of technology replacing a classic journalistic function is a direct threat to the livelihood of many news organizations who once made their names by being the first to every story. To adjust, outlets like <em>CNN</em> and the <em>Associated Press</em> have joined the Twitter rat race and adjusted editorial processes on other mediums to move quicker. But in a world where everyone knows about breaking news almost instantaneously, the rush to be first can cause more problems for news organizations than it solves.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the Boston Marathon bombings. After the explosions, information spread like wildfire. Some of it was false, as is always the case in a breaking news situation, but instead of acting with restraint, many news organizations <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/boston-marathon-tragedy-exposes-twitters-reporting-flaws_b18546" target="_blank">rushed to report falsehoods and speculations</a> as fact, like <em>CNN</em> reporting that suspects had been arrested on Wednesday night, or the <em>New York Post</em> clinging to a rumor that twelve people died in the explosions, or everybody and their mother reporting that the government had cut off cell phone service in Boston to prevent further remote detonations.</p>

<p>Ironically, we’re talking about this issue because despite the democratization of news, journalists still hold real power. Twitter accounts like <a href="http://twitter.com/ap" target="_blank">@AP</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cnnbrk" target="_blank">@CNNBRK</a> have millions of followers who trust them to report accurately. If you need evidence of that, look no further than when a hacker broke into the AP’s Twitter account and sent a fake tweet that caused automated stock traders to momentarily <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/04/24/dow-jones-drops-but-recovers-after-fake-ap-tweet/" target="_blank">send the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 143 points</a>.</p>

<p><em>Circa</em> editor-in-chief Dave Cohn <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/3aca5a9e6f89" target="_blank">called it an inevitable product of newsrooms trying to be first</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have the unstoppable force of news organizations that want to be first and want as much attention as possible, especially in times of breaking news. On the other hand we also have the immovable object of technology platforms like Twitter that will inevitably be where news breaks and where people flock to get information, especially when there is breaking news.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like this description because it correctly summarizes the conflict between two fields converging, but I wonder if news organizations need to be unstoppable. In the wake of both events, several future of news pundits called for journalists to stop trying to be first and instead find other ways to compete with social networks.</p>

<p>Here’s CUNY Professor Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/04/22/and-now-the-news-heres-what-we-dont-know-at-this-hour/" target="_blank">on an alternative model</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key skill of journalism today is saying what we *don’t* know, issuing caveats and also inviting the public to tell us what they know<br />
...<br />
If I ran a news organization, I would start a regular feature called, Here’s what you should know about what you’re hearing elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Mike Annany <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/breaking-news-pragmatically-some-reflections-on-silence-and-timing-in-networked-journalism/" target="_blank">wrote about silence and timing for the Nieman Lab</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Internet makes it possible for people other than traditional journalists to express themselves, quickly, to potentially large audiences. But the ideal press should be about more than this. It should be about demonstrating robust answers to two inseparable questions: Why do you need to know something now? And why do you need to say something now?</p></blockquote>

<p>Both of these authors make the same basic argument: there are ways to add value to news consumers without sacrificing accuracy by always trying to be first. This idea is compelling, but for news organizations worrying about disappearing bottom lines, Dan Gillmor’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/23/ap-twitter-hack-hoax-digital-media" target="_blank">argument in the <em>Guardian</em></a> ought to resonate more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Information providers forfeit some trust every time they make mistakes. That eventually, one hopes, affects the bottom line, or in a social context, the confidence of one's friends and peers.</p></blockquote>

<p>In an environment where trust is just about all they have left, perhaps publishers would be wise to re-think whether speed or accuracy is more valuable to the consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The decline in value isn't limited to consumers.</strong> Newspaper and magazine publishers used to serve a vital function for advertisers as well. Before the internet, print publications were one of the few places advertisers, especially local ones, could reach large, wealthy audiences. This gave publishers total control over pricing, making print advertising an extremely profitable business.</p>

<p>Today, no single website has a monopoly on any audience. If advertisers want to reach <em>New York Times</em> readers, they can do so on a variety of similar websites just as easily as they can on the Grey Lady’s site. Not only that, but advertisers now know more about these audiences than ever before. They can tell exactly how many users see ads, whether they click or engage on them, even target individual users based on past interactions. As a result, control over pricing has been flipped on its head. If your prices are too expensive, an advertiser can go elsewhere and reach the same exact people.</p>

<p>How are publishing companies coping? They’re re-thinking the value they offer to advertisers.</p>

<p>One approach is to sell so-called “native advertising,” which publications like <em>The Atlantic</em> and <em>Buzzfeed</em> are pursuing with a decent amount of success. The thinking goes something like this:</p>

<p>“The real value we offer isn't our ability to produce content that our audience wants to read, not the audience on its own. We can sell that expertise to advertisers.”</p>

<p>When this tactic works, the result is content that consumers want to read, share and interact with at much higher rates than traditional banner ads. This means organizations can charge more and, because the content is tailored specifically to the site it runs on, publishers regain some of the audience exclusivity they could claim in print.</p>

<p>When it backfires, however, the result can be disastrous for the organization’s credibility. Such was the case when The Atlantic <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/on-the-atlantics-scientology-ad-and-aftermath/273447/" target="_blank">published an advertisement</a> celebrating the Church of Scientology that felt completely at odds with the publication’s core value of intellectual integrity.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Thanks to the internet, most of the wealth of human knowledge is instantly and freely available.</strong> That’s tough luck for businesses that used to make money by charging for access to information, but it’s not stopping some publishers from taking a gamble that their information is worth paying for.</p>

<p>High-profile publishers like the New York Times have put up paywalls that require readers to pay for unlimited access to their websites, with some success. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/business/media/times-company-reports-a-drop-in-income.html" target="_blank">The Times announced</a> that while ad revenue decreased by 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2013, subscription revenues increased 6.5 percent.</p>

<p>The tactic isn’t a panacea, however. <em>USA Today</em> publisher Larry Kramer infamously told the world his newspaper’s content “<a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/usa-today-publisher-larry-kramer-were-not-unique-enough-charge-web-access-66791" target="_blank">wasn’t unique enough</a>” to charge customers for its content. He’s probably right. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, but research by University of Missouri Journalism Dean Esther Thorson <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/the-newsonomics-of-pulitzers-paywalls-and-investing-in-the-newsroom/" target="_blank">has found a direct link</a> between newsroom investment and paywall success:</p>

<blockquote><p>Input into the newsroom in dollars had far and away the greatest impact on all sources of revenues — both advertising and circulation.</p></blockquote>

<p>This leads me to a most obvious takeaway: If you want readers to value your content enough to pay for it, you should probably value it at least that much, too.</p>
