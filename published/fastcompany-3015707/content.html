<p><a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3015606/3-ways-hackers-will-invade-your-smart-home" target="_self">Yet another</a> smart home system is under attack. According to a report by <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/14/switch_off_your_neighbours_lights_with_an_app/" target="_blank">TheRegister.com</a>, the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003336/internet-things-people-innovating" target="_self">Philips Hue</a> "smart lighting" system ships with an extremely simple digital vulnerability at the point where the lights connect to a user's mobile device. An investigator has revealed that anyone with the right Philips app could control another system's lighting, provided they had access to the right information.</p>

<p>That information is the system's <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3015580/the-code-war/london-turns-off-snooping-trash-cans-that-tracked-pedestrians-phones" target="_self">MAC address</a>, the static ID of a net-connected device. Unfortunately, most hackers can find out MAC addresses relatively easily simply by sniffing the Wi-Fi signals coming from the home of a Vue owner. It's not a simple "click a button" hack, but it's not difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>The exploit isn't particularly dangerous or troublesome, as it seems unlikely to compromise safety or reveal any private user data. But the vulnerability does raise the possibility that a malicious hacker could upset a home's residents by toying with their lighting, and potentially run up expensive electricity bills by running the lights without the knowledge of the owner.</p>

<p>A similarly unexpected exploit of a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001464/kickstarter-way-trick-out-automate-your-home" target="_self">home automation system</a> was recently revealed when hackers found they could <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014949/yes-your-new-car-is-vulnerable-to-hackers" target="_self">remotely control some systems of a smart toilet</a>. For now, these hacks are more or less frivolous, but they do expose weak security expertise on behalf of the manufacturers...and as <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1774491/your-next-home-will-be-robot" target="_self">domotics</a> become more popular and the Internet of Things sees everything from your TV to your electricity meter wired up, then more dangerous hacks will likely hit the headlines.</p>
