<p>As <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/14/switch_off_your_neighbours_lights_with_an_app/" target="_blank">TheRegister.com</a> notes, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003336/internet-things-people-innovating" target="_self">Philips Hue</a> "smart lighting" has an especially simple digital vulnerability built into its design at the point where the lights connect to a user's mobile device like a smartphone for the purposes of controlling the color and intensity of lighting. An investigator has revealed that anyone with the right Philips app could control another system's lighting, provided they had access to one number.</p>

<p>That number is the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3015580/the-code-war/london-turns-off-snooping-trash-cans-that-tracked-pedestrians-phones" target="_self">MAC address</a>, the static ID of a net-connected device, and this is relatively easy to find by a suitably expert individual simply by sniffing the Wi-Fi signals coming from the home of a Vue owner. It's not a simple "click a button" hack, but it's not overly difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>The exploit isn't especially dangerous or troublesome, as it seems unlikely to compromise safety or reveal any private user data. But the hack does raise the possibility that a malicious hacker could upset a home's residents by toying with their lighting, and potentially run up expensive electricity bills by running the lights when the owner wasn't aware they were on. A similarly unexpected exploit of a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001464/kickstarter-way-trick-out-automate-your-home" target="_self">home automation system</a> was recently revealed when hackers said they could <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014949/yes-your-new-car-is-vulnerable-to-hackers" target="_self">remotely control some systems of a smart toilet</a>. For now these hacks are more or less frivolous, but they do expose weak security expertise on behalf of the manufacturers...and as <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1774491/your-next-home-will-be-robot" target="_self">domotics</a> become more popular and the Internet of Things sees everything from your TV to your electricity meter wired up, then more dangerous hacks will likely hit the headlines.</p>
