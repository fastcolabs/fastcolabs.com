<p>When Marshawn Lynch strode into the end zone Sunday, Seahawks' fans delighted in their own celebration so much so that their effort showed up on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/10282868/2013-nfl-playoffs-seattle-seahawks-fans-generated-earthquake-marshawn-lynch-td-run" target="_blank">three different seismographs</a>. And it's no accident. Qwest Field's aluminum construction works as an amplifier to the already fanatical following of football's most pacific-northwestern team.</p>

<p>It's important to note that seismographs read ground motion, not sound, although we can safely assume the fans' eruption was also loud.</p>

<p>It will a few days before the reading can be applied to the Richter scale, but this isn't the first time Seahawks' fans have man-made a quake. In 2011, the same Marshawn Lynch tallied another touchdown against the same New Orleans' Saints team they made suffer Sunday. The original quake registered between a one and two on the Richter scale. Scientists aren't sure yet which “<a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/seattle-seahawks/0ap2000000291693/Reliving-the-Beast-Quake" target="_blank">Beast Quake</a>” was stronger, but said they should know in the next few days.</p>
