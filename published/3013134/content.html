<h3><a name="The_Hacked_Newsroom_Why_CoLabs_Exists">The Hacked Newsroom: Why Co.Labs Exists</a></h3>

<p>It may not be obvious yet, but publishing and software are converging. Code is increasingly its own type of content, and content is becoming inseparable from the platform used to create it. That's why we started Co.Labs. This website is more than just a technology vertical: In addition to publishing stories, we operate as an internal laboratory at <em>Fast Company</em>, running experiments that (we hope) will help shape the future of this magazine, and maybe even the industry at large.</p>

<p>This post is a tracker (<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3009577/open-company/this-is-what-happens-when-publishers-invest-in-long-stories" target="_self">one of our experiments</a>) that will document every update to every experiment that we run, so that everyone can learn from what we're trying. If you'd like to participate, feel free to drop us a line on <a href="http://twitter.com/fastcolabs" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or comment on this post. We're glad to have you along for the ride.</p>

<h5><a name="We_waste_a_lot_of_time_producing_articles">We waste a lot of time producing articles.</a></h5>

<p>Before you see finished articles like this one, the raw materials live scattered across the hard drives of reporters, editors, videographers, photo editors, producers, and developers. Every time you start a big article, you feel like Sisyphus grabbing the boulder: You forage for info, you share things, you brainstorm--and you almost immediately start to lose track of your raw materials. <a href="http://writebot.com" target="_blank">Writebot</a> is Co.Labs Editor Chris Dannen's <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013005/open-company/why-the-boom-in-enterprise-tech-will-happen-in-new-york" target="_self">attempt to solve</a> this surprisingly complex problem.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Increase in articles produced</span></li>
  <li><span>Time saved per article</span></li>
</ul></p>

<h5><a name="Email_has_always_been_a_bad_place_to_push">Email has always been a bad place to push.</a></h5>

<p>Online publishers have been offering email subscriptions to their content since the beginning of the web. At the time, it was the best way to "push" content out to readers. But email, which needs to be repeatedly checked and sorted through, was never very good as a push notification service. Moreover, as platforms like Facebook and Twitter continue to draw users away from the inbox, we need to do a better job of reaching out to our readers where they spend time the most.</p>

<p>Twitter, in particular, is much better suited for "pushing" content to individual users with its direct message and @-reply features. To take advantage of these features, Co.Labs technical intern Jiyhun Lee is building a Twitter application that will allow readers to subscribe to our newsletter and updates to individual tracking posts, receiving links to new material via @-reply. We think users will enjoy receiving these messages on Twitter because, frankly, it's less annoying than email. The benefit to us is that these messages are public and much easier to share via retweet than emails, and we can track clicks and engagement much more easily than with email.</p>

<p>There's one more feature we're building in for our own use. We're addicted to real-time analytics, a problem that manifests itself publicly in the "Trending Articles" section of the sidebar, which pulls data from Chartbeat's API. In order to create a better feedback loop between analytics and our writers, Jiyhun's bot will soon send authors public encouragement via an @-reply when one of their articles is trending. Our hope is that this becomes a non-invasive way to help writers understand how their work performs, in real time.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Number of subscriptions</span></li>
  <li><span>Number of bot re-tweets</span></li>
  <li><span>Number of bot replies</span></li>
  <li><span>Clicks on Twitter-bot links vs. clicks on email newsletter links</span></li>
  <li><span>Return visitor rate increase</span></li>

<h5><a name="Our_tracking_posts_experiment_has_another_benefit_ebooks">Our tracking posts experiment has another benefit: e-books.</a></h5>

<p>Lots of publishers are trying to make money by reselling their content as e-books, and <em>Fast Company </em>is no exception. We recently signed an agreement with e-book publisher <a href="http://vook.com/" target="_blank">Vook</a> where we can decide to produce and sell any content as an e-book as long as it's over 20,000 words long. When we heard this at Co.Labs, we immediately thought of our tracking posts.</p>

<p>On the one hand, these stories are good candidates for short e-books because they're focused on a single subject, but they're broader than a single blog post. Over time, they grow to be long enough-- some are already approaching the 20,000-word mark--that reading them page-by-page is preferable to consuming them in the browser. Most importantly, these trackers contain lots of individual stories around the same theme that connect to each other in fascinating ways that don't make sense to explore in our "slow live-blog," but would work great as a book.</p>

<p>To help with the process, Co.Labs editor-at-large, Clay Andres (aka, <a href="http://" target="_blank"></a>), a veteran of the technical publishing industry, is going through and cleaning up our stub posts: Formatting them properly, tying up loose ends, looking for connections between discrete updates that can be expanded into new chapters of the story.</p>

<p>On the other hand, considering these posts as material for e-books raises some thorny legal and ethical questions. Many of our trackers excerpt and link to articles on other sites not produced by <em>Fast Company</em>. Our guideline for citing other posts is that we never use them as the main text of the article. Instead, we use them as starting points for our own analysis, adding value and new insights to the original author's work. While we believe this qualifies as fair use on our website, the rules might be different when we start to package and sell the text as standalone works. We're working with lawyers to hammer out some of these details, because we believe that they would make excellent e-books.</p>

<p>Assuming we can figure out the legal issues, look for some of these collections by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Number of e-books created</span></li>
  <li><span>Number of e-books sold</span></li>
  <li><span>Revenues resulting from e-book sales</span></li>
  <li><span>Profit on e-book sales</span></li>

<h5><a name="Audio_is_a_powerful_but_forgotten_sense">Audio is a powerful, but forgotten sense.</a></h5>

<p>Online publishers know the value of images--people love to flip through those things!--and video (hello, engagement),  but unless they have a dedicated podcasting division, most seem to have forgotten how much readers love simple audio recordings. There are numerous benefits to having an audio version of an article: You can experience it while in the car, on a device without a screen, or with your eyes closed, and we're willing to bet that we're missing out on a significant readership because we don't offer audio. That's why we're experimenting with adding audio versions of some of our most important articles using a startup called <a href="http://spokenlayer.com/" target="_blank">SpokenLayer</a>. Our first attempt is <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013005/open-company/why-the-boom-in-enterprise-tech-will-happen-in-new-york" target="_self">this article about Writebot</a>, another one of our experiments. Expect plenty more to come.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Audio plays</span></li>
  <li><span>Time on site increase</span></li>
  <li><span>Bounce rate decrease</span></li>
</ul></p>

<h5><a name="We_take_code_seriously">We take code seriously.</a></h5>

<p>We're writers and developers, so we care deeply about all our language. That's why our dev team helped us implement GitHub Gist embeds directly into our CMS. This means we can easily embed code in our posts with proper syntax highlighting for just about any programming language. So far, we've used this feature to display <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007320/tracking/bitcoin-coming-browser-near-you" target="_self">the hidden messages embedded in Bitcoin</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013141/open-company/how-we-made-nature-take-over-fast-companys-unplug-feature-using-parallax-scroll" target="_self">demonstrate how parallax scrolling works</a> in our CMS. Expect to see a lot more code from us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Number of Gists embedded</span></li>
  <li><span>Number of Gists forked</span></li>
  <li><span>Time on site increase</span></li>
  <li><span>Bounce rate decrease</span></li>

<h5><a name="Youll_be_surprised_what_happens_when_you_invest_in_quality">You'll be surprised what happens when you invest in quality.</a></h5>

<p>In mid-April, we went live with a half dozen articles which we call "stubs." The idea here is to plant a flag in a story right away with a short post--a "stub"--and then build the article as the story develops over time, rather than just cranking out short, discrete posts every time something new breaks. One of our writers refers to this aptly as a "slow live blog." Here's <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3009577/open-company/this-is-what-happens-when-publishers-invest-in-long-stories" target="_self">what we learned</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Time on site increase</span></li>
  <li><span>Bounce rate decrease</span></li>
  <li><span>Return visitor increase</span></li>

<h5><a name="The_browser_is_the_new_universal_gaming_device">The browser is the new universal gaming device.</a></h5>

<p>To celebrate <em>Pac-Man</em>'s birthday, <em>Fast Company</em> developer Harry Guillermo built his own version using JavaScript. Just for fun, <em>Fast Company</em>'s CTO, Matt Mankins, used Guillermo's work to <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3010050/v0/pac-man-vs-us-honoring-the-33rd-birthday-of-a-video-game" target="_self">build a social version</a> of <em>Pac-Man</em>.</p>

<h5><a name="You_have_two_choices">You have two choices:</a></h5>

<p>You can build an app that might save a day of work for everyone in your company but might also end up wasting more of your time than it saves. Or, you can or spend 3 hours doing mindless manual tasks and make everyone else who touches your work miserable. We chose to spend the time building a <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3009172/make-google-chrome-do-your-grunt-work-for-you" target="_self">quick Chrome extension</a> that helped save nearly a day of our judges' time on the Target/CoLabs Retail Accelerator.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Time saved</span></li>
</ul></p>

<h5><a name="Our_home_page_isnt_for_everyone">Our home page isn't for everyone.</a></h5>

<p>It’s useful if you’re one of our core readers who knows who we are and wants to read every article. If you’re not one of those people (and the chances are pretty good you’re not), you may benefit more from something like the new <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3009587/you-cant-have-too-many-home-pages" target="_self">Co.Labs Back Page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Measures of Success:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li><span>Backpage click-through rate vs. home page click-through rate</span></li>
  <li><span>Return visitor rate increase</span></li>
  <li><span>Bounce rate decrease</span></li>
</ul></p>
