<p>A new iPhone app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/confide-your-off-record-messenger/id779883419?mt=8" target="_blank">Confide</a> aims to be a SnapChat for professionals, providing encrypted, disappearing messages for off-the-record communication.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://getconfide.com/" target="_blank">app</a> doesn't allow for scandalous selfies--messages are strictly text only. And to prevent screenshots, the message are revealed only a few words at a time as the user swipes a virtual wand across the text. Once the whole text is seen, the message evaporates. The app was introduced Wednesday by a team led by <a href="http://www.yext.com/" target="_blank">Yext</a> CEO Howard Lerman and former AOL executive Jon Brod.</p>

<p>On the Confide blog, Brod <a href="http://blog.getconfide.com/" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the idea for the app came after Lerman emailed him to do a reference check on a former colleague of Brod's. He preferred not do it in writing, so that meant getting in touch via telephone.</p>

<p>"The phone tag went on for six days," Brod wrote. "When we finally connected, we marveled at the inefficiency of the situation, and the ultimate magnitude of it."</p>

<p>Confide should allow users the candidness of a phone call or coffee meeting with the convenience of email, its founders say. End-to-end encryption means that only the recipient, and not Confide's technicians, should be able to decrypt the messages.</p>

<p>The company suggests the app will be useful for job referrals and other HR discussions, confidential deal negotiations and what Confide refers to, perhaps optimistically, as "good-natured office gossip."</p>

<p>Others, including the British tabloid <em>The Daily Mail</em>, have <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2536427/The-app-helps-CHEAT-Disappearing-text-software-keeps-illicit-messages-hidden-partner.html" target="_blank">suggested</a> the app might become popular with cheating spouses looking to send messages that can't be found by their partners and perhaps seeking the plausible deniability installing a business-oriented app brings over being caught with existing tools such as Snapchat.</p>

<p>Whatever the content may be, revealing the message a few words at a time and displaying a Snapchat-style warning against screenshots should make it difficult for anyone to surreptitiously keep a copy without, say, shooting video from another device.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, the world had permanence," Brod wrote in the blog post. "Today, with Confide, professionals have an off-the-record option."</p>
