<p>The flying machines ran the gamut. Drone-style quadcopters had a strong showing, which isn’t a surprise considering their code is widely available in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/" target="_blank">hobbyist</a> and <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" target="_blank">enthusiast</a> spheres. The more daring teams went with aeronautical novelties like the wing-flapping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopter" target="_blank">ornithopter</a> (which we’re <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3016373/watch-this-ultralight-3-d-printed-flapping-ornithopter-buzz-around-like-a-dragonfly" target="_self">admittedly partial to</a>), a finned-wing design that looked like a boogie board with a propeller strapped to the front, and even a gas balloon.</p>

<p>Many of the designs defied easy description--like this helicopter-format tri-rotor drone.</p>

<p>Some of the designs seemed outright silly, especially compared to the competition.</p>

<p>But it was clear that a lot of thought went into developing legitimately airworthy machines out of extant Dyson parts and materials.</p>

<p>Even the obstacle course was made of Dyson parts.</p>

<p>The goal: to get these aerial wonders around an obstacle course without encountering hazards or popping balloons...to varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>We’ve entertained Dyson innovation before, but mostly for cleaning up coffee grounds. Here, Sir James Dyson talks about problem solving, and the anatomy of one of his newest machines.</p>
