<p>“We certainly don’t want to cause any inconvenience to [San Francisco] residents and we’re trying alternative ways to get Googlers to work,” a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/01/08/google-offers-san-francisco-workers-new-way-get-office-catamaran/?fromcat=all#!rIlQt" target="_blank">spokesperson for Google said</a> about the company's plans to boat people to work.</p>

<p>Inconvenienced? Not as much. Pissed off? Very.</p>

<p>Google and other Silicon Valley tech companies have come under fire from San Francisco and Oakland residents for the gentrification of the city--and for (they say) abusing free public transit to cart around mobs of employees. The fury erupted into protests last month, with residents <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/12/20/san-francisco-tech-shuttle-buses-blocked/4147335/" target="_blank">vandalizing</a> and <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2013/12/20/bus-blocked-again-in-tech-boom-backlash/" target="_blank">blocking the path</a> of Google- and Apple-bound shuttle busses.</p>

<p>Locals are pressuring tech companies to invest more money into the city amidst issues with rising housing prices and strained transit systems. Google and other Valley tech companies have been using public bus stops to bus an estimated 45,000 employees between their homes and offices daily.</p>

<p>Instead of investing in the city, the company rented the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM28sVBkv14" target="_blank">Triumphant</a>, a 149-passenger private catamaran that travels between San Francisco and Redwood City to cart commuters. The luxury wi-fi equipped boat will run two trips in the morning and two trips in the evening for employees on <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/01/07/google-launches-private-sf-bay-ferry-service-to-shuttle-workers/" target="_blank">a trial basis</a>.</p>

<p>In a news conference on Monday, Mayor Ed Lee introduced an eighteen-month trial program that will limit the commuter buses to the use of 200 pubic stops (out of the total 2,500), operation under guidelines (like yielding to Muni), and "charges of around $1 per stop per day," according to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/us-google-commuterbus-sanfrancisco-idUSBREA0517L20140107" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. The result will pay an estimated $1.5 million, or about $100,000 per company, to the city, which is definitely small potatoes considering enterprises like Google are worth around <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/google/" target="_blank">$268 billion</a>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to rectify this chump change as a means for helping Bay Area residents get back on their feet as the income gap widens. Jennifer Cust, an organizer for <a href="http://evictionfreesummer.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Eviction Free San Francisco</a>, retorted Mayor's Lee's shuttle-payment plans in a <a href="http://www.hrcsf.org/" target="_blank">press release for the Housing Rights Committee</a>: "We are prepared to be demand more of City Hall if it appears that Mayor Lee's plan is not realistically aggressive enough to address the concerns of poor, working, and middle-class San Franciscans."</p>

<p>Mayor Lee's program will go up for a vote next month and may mitigate some upset from San Franciscans. However, the Triumphant, which is privately operated and therefore will evade any city payments, may contradict his efforts.</p>

<p>In any case, if Silicon Valley techies continue to complain about the city they inhabit (i.e. <a href="http://uptownalmanac.com/2013/08/tech-founder-complains-about-shithole-city-hes-forced-make-his-millions" target="_blank">Peter Shih</a> of Y Combinator and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/11/greg_gopman_facebook_post_homeless_ruining_san_francisco_should_be_segregated.html" target="_blank">Greg Gopman</a> formerly of AngelHack) without illustrating real attempts to improve it themselves, locals will only get angrier.</p>
