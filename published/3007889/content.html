<h3><a name="Its_2013_Do_you_know_where_your_stuff_is">It's 2013. Do you know where  your stuff is?</a></h3>

<p>Your computer's hard drive is no longer the catch-all bucket it once was. Now it shares duty with software services that store data remotely, using local storage only sporadically. But those cloud services--Rdio, Dropbox, Pandora, iCloud and Google Apps are just a few I pay for--add up to hundreds of dollars per year, presumably until you die or just stop caring. And this is your most prized content we're talking about! Irreplaceable stuff like home videos, ripped albums, vacation photos, work documents--so what becomes of this stuff ain't trivial.</p>

<p>The incumbents, Apple, Google and Microsoft, seem to know that their lock on your files is fading--and with it, your lock-in to their OS. New "social" services like Apple's iMessage, for example, isolate themselves from third-party networks, where legacy desktop apps like Apple's iChat app for Mac OS X once accommodated services like AIM, Gtail and Jabber. What gives?</p>

<p>The grab for lock-in matters poignantly now, as cloud services begin to tip mainstream. Today's short-sighted storage choice can be tomorrow's major pain in the ass, and tectonic changes in the market are ensuring that this is a problem that even the most technophobic users will begin to take notice. Developers need foresight to ensure their users don't get disenfranchised because of storage issues that are outside their control.</p>

<h3><a name="What_This_Story_Is_Tracking">What This Story Is Tracking</a></h3>

<p>There are two big trends that seem to be coalescing. The first: the segmentation of file storage across different apps and services. In a more abstract way, this reflects the larger movement of data into the cloud, but we'll focus on the way this effects individual users, not entire systems. The second trend: the appearance of new, viable mobile operating systems that never could have survived in the Apple-Microsoft desktop duoculture.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook sees the incumbent OS makers losing their grip.</strong> Today the company is staking out what it believes to be the three must-have services in one centralized Facebook hub. If they can own these three buckets of your data, then it's much easier to dragoon you into using other Facebook apps and services that rely on them.

<blockquote><p>The tweaked version of Google’s Android operating system will put a Facebook user’s content right at the forefront of the operating system, integrating Facebook apps like Messenger, photos, and contacts into an easily accessible form. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Big OS makers are going to spend as much money as it takes to stem the change.</strong> Nothing threatens device makers like the proliferation of operating systems and app-centric cloud storage, because it turns their hardware into a mere carrier. Ham-handed corporate habits make them too stubborn to be interoperable--iCloud doesn't connect to SkyDrive, for example--which means that while they're stalling change, they're not doing much to solve the problem for users, as iCloud, SkyDrive and Google Apps augment the complexity by creating more segmentation.

<blockquote><p>Because end user applications and experiences differentiate these filesystems, I expect to see a flurry of acquisitions of next generation content creation tools that users love by these companies all in effort to create loyalty and build lock-in to a particular file system.<br />

<p><strong>Apple, Microsoft and Google <em>have a hard time even accepting each others' apps should exist on their respective mobile platforms</em>.</strong> Considering that no such restrictions are enforced on their desktop OSes (and considering that desktop OSes like Mac OS and iOS seem to be converging) it will be interesting to see if intra-platform hostilities increase or decrease from here. The grand prize goes to anyone who can explain why OS makers defend the brand-purity of their mobile UX so much more than their desktop platforms.

<blockquote><p>Back in December, it was reported that Apple and Microsoft were at odds over SkyDrive, with Apple refusing to allow any updates to the app after Microsoft launched paid storage tiers for the service. Apple's rules require that developers offering any sort of paid content or service through their apps use the company's In App Subscription mechanism, which nets Apple 30% of revenues. Developers are also prohibited from including external sign-up links in apps to direct users to external addresses where they can purchase such plans without going through Apple. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Who needs loyalty anymore?</strong> When all you need is a bunch of cloud-enabled apps to access your stuff, it becomes frictionless to move from one device or OS to another. That may mean more OSes are on the horizon--let's hope increasingly specialized ones? Via <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21159531" target="_blank">BBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The [Firefox OS] platform is based on the HTML5 web programming language and is being marketed as offering software writers more "freedom" than alternatives. However, it faces competition from other soon-to-be-released systems. Blackberry 10, Ubuntu, Tizen and Sailfish are all due for release for smartphones before the end of 2013, joining a market already occupied by Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry 7 and Symbian among others.<br />

<p><strong>Virtualization might (finally) be a reality in the workplace.</strong> Sure, this ReadWrite piece is guest authored by a guy whose company sells virtual infrastructure--but just because he’s shilling doesn’t mean he’s wrong. If virtualization is finally here for real in the enterprise, it will create tectonic changes for everyone; trends in enterprise and consumer software are often interrelated, so the notion of desktop as a service may become an expectation of some enterprise workers when they use their home computer. Via <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/03/29/the-next-phase-of-cloud-computing-daas-maas-draas" target="_blank">ReadWrite</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) was supposed to address many of these challenges, but it came with its own set of issues. While it has been promoted as a technology that can save businesses money, large upfront capital expenses and complexity have created barriers to virtual desktop adoption. With DaaS, savings come from operational expense reductions from centralizing and reducing administration and hardware savings over time. DaaS delivers faster desktop deployment, enhanced security, less downtime and lower support costs - and can enable a truly mobile workforce.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>No file system is a no-go</strong>. This is the deepest analysis I’ve found of a vision of a future in which "users simply have apps” and are not conscious of storage repositories. And it doesn’t bode well for workplace users. We may need new UX paradigms. Via <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/03/the-death-of-the-file-system/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">JohnnyHolland</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Documents associated with them appear magically. Presto.” While this might sound like some kind of user experience utopia, I have a grave concern that eliminating a file system in this manner misses a huge audience. Us. While opening Pages to work on the family newsletter might make sense for casual home users of a computer system, it does not make sense in a professional context. In the professional world, we work on projects. Projects are composed of many different types of files. And yes, we might have the same apps open all day, but do we want to be forced to duplicate a hierarchy of information in every single application? No. Besides, “projects” are just one type of organizational scheme. As a user experience designer, I’ve seen a lot of professionals in other fields organizing a lot of stuff in a lot of different ways. So even attempts at inter-app organization around the concept of a project, such as Microsoft’s Project Center, are not effective replacements for an infinitely flexible organization scheme like simple folders. <br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Author Fred Beecher goes on:</p>

<blockquote><p>We still need a high-level organization system of some kind. And that is the challenge. It’s a challenge because that problem has already been solved by the file system. The challenge is to solve it better. At Interaction11, Tim Wood called for designers to reject the “complacency artifacts” of the past, design patterns that have lost relevance in the modern world but continue to be used simply because that’s how things are done. He encouraged us to be bold enough to reinvent wheels that need reinventing, and that’s exactly where we’re at with file systems. Gestural user interfaces, effortless portability, and ubiquitous network access… All these things and more are redefining how people interact with technology. UX designers need to recognize this and push themselves beyond the limits of our vision. <br />

<p><strong>Here hare five high-profile Mac developers bitching about iCloud. </strong>If these guys can't make it work, it's officially broken. That leaves Apple vulnerable to abandonment on behalf of their historically loyal and talented developer base. Via <a href="http://rms2.tumblr.com/post/46505165521/the-gathering-storm-our-travails-with-icloud-sync" target="_blank">Rich Siegel</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Just works” might be the customer experience; but developers must do more to support iCloud (or any new OS technology) than simply flipping a switch. Things can go wrong, and they often do... In general, when iCloud data doesn’t synchronize correctly (and this happens, in practice, often), neither the developer nor the user has any idea why.<br />

<p><strong>Efficient data storage methods might render the whole problem moot.</strong> The idea that the “file system” is headed for tectonic changes is predicated on the continued growth of our data. More efficient storage methods could allow us to keep creating new information while allowing our storage media size to plateau. (If you’re working on Erasure Coding or anything comparable, <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisdannen" target="_blank">drop me a line on Twitter</a> and explain whether this supposition could come to pass.) Via <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/07/20/object-storage/" target="_blank">DataCenterKnowledge</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Indeed, applications are gradually taking over the role of the file systems, making the latter obsolete. Those applications often run far more efficiently when they talk to the storage directly, without a file system in between – by using REST, a standard interface that comes with Object Storage platforms. A much more efficient approach is to build storage pools based on an Erasure Coding approach. This technology was first used for communication with deep space, when messages had to be understandable even if parts were lost in the transfer. EC works like a Sudoku puzzle: blanks can be calculated based on the remaining information. Data Objects are split up in many small chunks, from which calculations are generated (with some small overhead). Those calculations are stored on the system, as widely spread as possible. When a disk (or a larger unit) fails, the data can still be read since they are calculations. Missing data can be re-generated.</p></blockquote>
