<p>A day after Creative Cloud came out it was cracked and posted on The Pirate’s Bay. We all expected it to happen eventually, but a one day turnaround is pretty legit. It might mean that hackers have become unstoppable. That it doesn't even take effort anymore for them to work around an authentication/limited sharing system. But this seems unlikely. Why would hacking so greatly outpace legitimate development? Perhaps the answer is much simpler: Adobe security just wasn't trying very hard.</p>

<p>A desire to reduce piracy may not have been the only motivator in the decision to move to Creative Cloud, but it was certainly understood to be a factor. Photoshop alone is one of the most pirated pieces of software ever. Yet when Mark Wilson <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672530/adobe-5-reasons-we-killed-the-creative-suite" target="_self">interviewed</a> Adobe’s director of product marketing, Heidi Voltmer, after the Creative Cloud announcement she said,</p>

<blockquote><p>Reducing piracy really isn’t one of the key things we looked at with the Cloud. The reality is people learn how to hack around copy protection and pirate if they really want to. There’s no way to avoid piracy.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen told <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/05/06/adobe-ceo-interview-creative-cloud/" target="_blank">Mashable</a> around the same time that, “It allows us to provide different offerings in different emerging markets without worrying about gray markets.”</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that if Creative Cloud’s price per month is cheap enough, it will entice most average users to simply pay for full privileges, rather than making a foray into the unreliable and frustrating world of disable activation scripts or serial generators. Even if Creative Cloud only acts as a minor deterrent to pirates it may be enough of a gain to satisfy Adobe for now. And there seems to be the beginning of a more general <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tired-of-the-war-on-piracy-adobe-hopes-to-turn-pirates-into-customers-130625/" target="_blank">shift</a> toward thinking about piracy as a demand indicator and sign of consumer enthusiasm rather than a death knell. It’s been years since there was any question that piracy was here to stay, but many industries that would benefit from a new point of view haven’t been able to reframe piracy in a productive way. If Adobe is using Creative Cloud to let go of old battles and test the waters they might actually be pushing cloud suites forward.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office isn’t the best suite for everything, but after dominating word processing, spreadsheets, and slide sets for 20 years, it certainly has brand cachet. And when Microsoft introduced the cloud-based Office 365 in October 2010, it was supposed to represent a logical next step in the suite’s evolution. Progress. But in the ensuing 2 and a half years, Office mobile apps have been glaringly missing from the iOS and Android ecosystems. Microsoft seems to have been intentionally keeping them exclusive to Windows Phone and the Surface tablets.</p>

<p>Without deep mobile integration, though, the SkyDrive aspect of Office 365 seems pretty wasted. Cloud syncing doesn’t hurt, but it’s not regularly useful if a user isn’t on multiple devices. And the newly released iOS app has the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/office-mobile-for-iphone-and-windows-phone-have-the-exact-same-functionality-gallery-7000016862/" target="_blank">same functionality</a> as the Windows Phone version. It’s good for minor rewording or typo fixes, but it’s not the place to conjure a document or slide set from scratch. Basically the app iOS users have been waiting for isn’t even that dynamic, and it’s the same build that’s supposed to be drawing users to Windows mobile. The strategy is limited no matter which way you look at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Launching Office Mobile on the iPad could present additional competitive pressure for Windows 8 and Surface. Microsoft may be dragging its feet on Office for the iPad and Android for competitive reasons intended to give Windows 8 and Surface a chance to gain traction. Our view is that this delay is enabling competition for Office to entrench itself on these platforms and Office is a bigger business for Microsoft than Windows, so we see more urgency to preserve and extend the Office franchise cross platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the launch of a more unified iWorks at WWDC last week and Google’s continued improvement to the Drive app, it seems more dangerous than ever for Microsoft to withhold Office from Android and iOS users. People who would normally turn to Office out of habit will seek platform-available alternatives out of necessity and may never come back.</p>

<p>More and more developers are taking their work suites and services into the cloud. They’re providing ways for users to work anywhere, from any machine and maybe collaborate more efficiently. Maybe. This model allows software makers to deliver incremental updates more easily and reduce illicit installer distribution. But most users are accustomed to working with what is available locally on their computers and sharing work by transferring documents via email, a local server, or even a thumb drive. How can they break free of those habits, and what do developers need to deliver for people to work better and faster in the cloud?</p>
