<p>I’ve always been prejudiced against Apple’s iWork suite. I think it stems from a time in the mid 2000s when iWork applications, especially Numbers, were behind the Microsoft Office curve. But when Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/10/apple-announces-iwork-for-icloud-for-both-mac-and-ios/" target="_blank">announced iWork for iCloud at WWDC</a> last month I realized that my assessment of the suite was outdated. iWork was lookin’ fly. And now <a href="http://qz.com/99935/apples-new-web-based-software-will-make-you-realize-how-awful-google-drive-is/" target="_blank">developers with early access</a> are raving about the iCloud version. When it comes to inhabitants of the Apple ecosystem it seems like Microsoft and Google are going to have real competition.</p>

<p>It’s true that Excel still edges Numbers out for most professional users, but in terms of overall features and integration of a web-based suite, iWork (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) seems rock solid. And while Microsoft Office 365 has only taken <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013336/microsoft-office-for-ios-looks-like-a-bait-and-switch#Microsoft_Office_For_iOS_Looks_LikeBaitAndSwitch" target="_self">limited first steps to specifically engage Apple users</a>, especially on mobile devices, iWork is poised to grab market-share. When iWork for iCloud is publicly released in October, it makes sense that the cross-platform compatibility will lure Apple users to go all in on iWork, whether they had previously adopted the local applications or not.</p>

<p>An important factor in all of this is price. Currently Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are $20 each in the Mac App Store, and the iOS versions are $10 each. That puts the whole package at $90 if you want all three apps on your computer plus mobile. Microsoft 365 is $100/year or $10/month for access to local and mobile applications. But like Google Drive, it seems that iWork for iCloud is going to be free.</p>

<p>The Internet rabble is saying that <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/07/02/does-iwork-for-icloud-mean-native-iwork-mac-and-ios-apps-will-become-free-services/" target="_blank">it would be inconsistent of Apple</a> to offer iWork for iCloud for free while continuing to charge for the local and mobile applications. And many people are predicting that Apple will <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iwork-for-ipad-free-2013-7" target="_blank">make iWork free</a> on all of its devices. They argue that such a strategy would be in line with the precedent set by the iLife suite and mobile apps like iMessage, and could be a talking point that helps Apple sell even more hardware.</p>

<p>But I don’t see the conflict, and to me it doesn’t even seem necessary for Apple to make iWork free. If they want to do it, great, and it would probably be a solid strategy for luring users away from Microsoft and Google, but I don’t see it as make or break. With the iCloud rollout, iWork will be offering a Google Drive competitor. And it will also be rivaling Office 365, still for $10 less, with significantly better integration and mobile capability than Microsoft will be able to offer for at least a year. For those in the Apple ecosystem, iWork will draw users and be an attractive option whether or not all versions become free. It also seems possible, though there hasn’t been mention of this as far as I know, that local and mobile iWork applications could move to a subscription model like Office 365.</p>

<p>The group I see thinking most seriously about switching to iWork will be Mac owners who have and use old versions of the Microsoft Office Suite right now, but have been confused or deterred by Microsoft’s move to Office 365. I would think that these users would be most tempted by iWork, because it will offer everything, free web apps like Google Drive, local applications like the traditional Microsoft Office Suite, plus iOS apps with more extensive functionality than what Microsoft is offering. By the time Office 365 catches up in mobile, iOS customers may be gone, and likewise Google Drive may lose out because it has limited local options for people who don’t have consistent Internet access. Google and Microsoft need to make moves if they want to keep iWork for iCloud from eroding their respective user bases, and they need to do it soon.</p>

<h4><a name="Adobe_Isnt_Losing_Any_Sleep_Over_Creative_Cloud_Piracy">Adobe Isn't Losing Any Sleep Over Creative Cloud Piracy</a></h4>

<p><span class="subhead">June 28, 2013</span></p>

<p>A day after Creative Cloud came out it was cracked and posted on The Pirate’s Bay. We all expected it to happen eventually, but a one day turnaround is pretty legit. It might mean that hackers have become unstoppable. That it doesn't even take effort anymore for them to work around an authentication/limited sharing system. But this seems unlikely. Why would hacking so greatly outpace legitimate development? Perhaps the answer is much simpler: Adobe security just wasn't trying very hard.</p>

<p>A desire to reduce piracy may not have been the only motivator in the decision to move to Creative Cloud, but it was certainly understood to be a factor. Photoshop alone is one of the most pirated pieces of software ever. Yet when Mark Wilson <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672530/adobe-5-reasons-we-killed-the-creative-suite" target="_self">interviewed</a> Adobe’s director of product marketing, Heidi Voltmer, after the Creative Cloud announcement she said,</p>

<blockquote><p>Reducing piracy really isn’t one of the key things we looked at with the Cloud. The reality is people learn how to hack around copy protection and pirate if they really want to. There’s no way to avoid piracy.</p></blockquote>

<p>And Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen told <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/05/06/adobe-ceo-interview-creative-cloud/" target="_blank">Mashable</a> around the same time that, “It allows us to provide different offerings in different emerging markets without worrying about gray markets.”</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that if Creative Cloud’s price per month is cheap enough, it will entice most average users to simply pay for full privileges, rather than making a foray into the unreliable and frustrating world of disable activation scripts or serial generators. Even if Creative Cloud only acts as a minor deterrent to pirates it may be enough of a gain to satisfy Adobe for now. And there seems to be the beginning of a more general <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/tired-of-the-war-on-piracy-adobe-hopes-to-turn-pirates-into-customers-130625/" target="_blank">shift</a> toward thinking about piracy as a demand indicator and sign of consumer enthusiasm rather than a death knell. It’s been years since there was any question that piracy was here to stay, but many industries that would benefit from a new point of view haven’t been able to reframe piracy in a productive way. If Adobe is using Creative Cloud to let go of old battles and test the waters they might actually be pushing cloud suites forward.</p>

<p>More and more developers are taking their work suites and services into the cloud. They’re providing ways for users to work anywhere, from any machine and maybe collaborate more efficiently. Maybe. This model allows software makers to deliver incremental updates more easily and reduce illicit installer distribution. But most users are accustomed to working with what is available locally on their computers and sharing work by transferring documents via email, a local server, or even a thumb drive. How can they break free of those habits, and what do developers need to deliver for people to work better and faster in the cloud?</p>

<h4><a name="Microsoft_Office_For_iOS_Looks_LikeBaitAndSwitch">Microsoft Office For iOS Looks Like...Bait-And-Switch</a></h4>

<p><span class="subhead">June 20, 2013</span></p>

<p>Microsoft Office isn’t the best suite for everything, but after dominating word processing, spreadsheets, and slide sets for 20 years, it certainly has brand cachet. And when Microsoft introduced the cloud-based Office 365 in October 2010, it was supposed to represent a logical next step in the suite’s evolution. Progress. But in the ensuing 2 and a half years, Office mobile apps have been glaringly missing from the iOS and Android ecosystems. Microsoft seems to have been intentionally keeping them exclusive to Windows Phone and the Surface tablets.</p>

<p>Without deep mobile integration, though, the SkyDrive aspect of Office 365 seems pretty wasted. Cloud syncing doesn’t hurt, but it’s not regularly useful if a user isn’t on multiple devices. And the newly released iOS app has the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/office-mobile-for-iphone-and-windows-phone-have-the-exact-same-functionality-gallery-7000016862/" target="_blank">same functionality</a> as the Windows Phone version. It’s good for minor rewording or typo fixes, but it’s not the place to conjure a document or slide set from scratch. Basically the app iOS users have been waiting for isn’t even that dynamic, and it’s the same build that’s supposed to be drawing users to Windows mobile. The strategy is limited no matter which way you look at it.</p>

<p>Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Equity Research,  <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/06/14/microsoft-office-365-for-ios-step-in-right-direction-says-nomura/" target="_blank">noted</a> that Microsoft is probably keeping Office mobile apps from other platforms, specifically the iPad and Android, in an attempt to make Windows mobile devices like the Surface more appealing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Launching Office Mobile on the iPad could present additional competitive pressure for Windows 8 and Surface. Microsoft may be dragging its feet on Office for the iPad and Android for competitive reasons intended to give Windows 8 and Surface a chance to gain traction. Our view is that this delay is enabling competition for Office to entrench itself on these platforms and Office is a bigger business for Microsoft than Windows, so we see more urgency to preserve and extend the Office franchise cross platform.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the launch of a more unified iWorks at WWDC last week and Google’s continued improvement to the Drive app, it seems more dangerous than ever for Microsoft to withhold Office from Android and iOS users. People who would normally turn to Office out of habit will seek platform-available alternatives out of necessity and may never come back.</p>
