<p>To get to the stage where people can interact with human-like robotic companions, whatever their function, will require overcoming three main challenges: building an AI that is intelligent enough to not only speak like a human, but to process a human’s complex speech patterns to understand emotional context; building synthetic organs that look and feel indistinguishable from a human’s; and building an underlying mechanical skeleton structure that allows the robot to move like a human.</p>

<p>That last challenge is already well on its way to being overcome thanks to a group of researchers at the University of Tokyo who have built a robot called Kenshiro. The amazing thing about Kenshiro is that its movements don’t rely on cogs or pistons, but on a pulley-like system that mimics how actual muscles in the human body works (human muscles only pull, they don’t push). Kenshiro has over 160 “muscles.” That’s a far cry from the 640+ in a human body, but just take a look at what researchers in 2013 can do with just 160:</p>

<p>But what happens once you get the mechanics down? A robot, even one that moves and looks like us, won’t feel real until it can give the illusion of understand our own -- and expressing its own -- emotional complexities. The most advanced “AI” most of us have access to nowadays comes in the form of iOS’s Siri -- and we all know how well that works. But even if true AI takes decades longer to achieve than human-like movement, that doesn’t mean we won’t have lifelike robots before then, as <a href="http://www.livescience.com/37474-lifelike-android-debut-at-tech-conference.html" target="_blank">Japanese roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro successfully showed off this week.</a></p>

<p>In a show in New York, Ishiguro took the stage next to a lifelike robot version of himself -- called a “Geminoid.” The robot moved and spoke like the real Ishiguro, but that’s because it was "tele-operated" by a colleague offstage. The robot had to be remote controlled, of course, because of one big drawback -- there’s currently no AI that could make it act and work like a human. However, this “drawback” also lends itself to demonstrating another benefit of pre-AI robots: if a human can control lifelike robots then we can push these surrogates out into the world to handle jobs that are too dangerous for flesh and blood.</p>

<p>However, given all the robotics advances in just the last year alone, we still are a ways off from having robotic companions. As <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/14/japanese-researchers-continue-their-quest-to-build-life-like-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank">David J. Hill writes for SingularityHub</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the years to come, news of robotics development will only increase as we watch researchers put humans together much like Doctor Manhattan. Whether individual bones and muscles will work best or some other design will prove superior will only be resolved once each design can be tested. In the end, the greatest challenge may not be creating individual robotics systems or artificial intelligence, but packing all of these components into a single robot.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is possible one day, however, to think that a much older version of yourself will be explaining to your live-in robot that their lineage started way back in the day with the creation of Kenshiro and the Ishiguro Geminoid.</p>

<h3><a name="Why_Were_Tracking_The_EverCloser_World_of_Sexual_Computing">Why We’re Tracking The Ever-Closer World of Sexual Computing</a></h3>

<p>Sex is kind of a big deal for us humans. It drives a lot of what we do, and influences a large part of our world outside of the bedroom. It’s why some men seek high-paying, high-status jobs. It’s why some religions feel they need to issue moral laws. And whether we admit it or not, it can be a big part of our recipe for self-worth.</p>

<p>Sex has been synced with technology for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. If you’ve ever been in the <a href="http://www.sexmachinesmuseum.com/" target="_blank">Sex Machine Museum in Prague</a>, you’ll know what I’m talking about. The museum holds some interesting mechanical (some even steam-powered) pieces of kit that were designed to enhance a user’s sexual experiences. When the technology of moving pictures were invented, pornos were some of the first things shot. Matter of fact, the porn industry arose hand-in-hand with the tech industry. Porn companies were some of the first to adopt the new technologies of VHS, DVD, and streaming video. And how long did it take <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/05/29/yes-of-course-there-will-be-google-glass-porn/" target="_blank">porn companies to jump on Google Glass</a>? About two minutes.</p>

<p>But sex and tech increasingly aren’t only linked by new mediums to show skin flicks. Outside of the medical industry, the most common places you’ll find research into synthetic skins are at sex toy companies. And while many extrapolate their fear of today’s drones and see them morphing into Terminator-like killing robots in the not-too-distant future, if history has shown us anything, we’re much more likely to see fully functioning sexbots first. Sound crazy? It’s not. After all, a robot getting pounded in the bedroom needs to absorb a lot less stress than one getting pounded in the battlefield.</p>

<p>And mark my words: one day we will be fucking robots.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to get a cheap laugh. It will happen. I know this because some very bright engineers across the globe are already working on technologies that will enable future sexbots to exist: <a href="http://www.ece.uc.edu/devices/Downloads/Documents/Publications/140426%20-%20Article%20Artificial%20Microfluidic%20Skin.pdf" target="_blank">synthetic skins with breathable pores that are capable of sweating</a>; artificial intelligence that understands emotional context; human-accurate voice synthesis and facial recognition. And those are the hard parts. Believe it or not, building a robot that can mimic human movements <a href="http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/humanoids-a-human-centred-mechatronics/advr-humanoids-projects/compliant-humanoid-platform-coman.html" target="_blank">isn’t that far off</a>.</p>

<p>Before anyone jumps the gun and says that sexbots will lead to the moral decay of humanity and kill all human interaction, let’s not forget that sex with robots isn't necessarily just for kinky cyber fun. It could have mental and social health benefits--like by allowing disabled people to have physical relationships or by eliminating the risk of sexually transmitted diseases from popular sex tourism areas across the globe, such as Las Vegas or Thailand.</p>
