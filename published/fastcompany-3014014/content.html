<p>Google Glass has already experienced its first foray into <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/07/first-arrest-captured-on-google-glass-points-to-a-little-brother-future/" target="_blank">voyeuristic YouTube-bait</a> with its basic native features--namely, the camera. But a slew of apps could turn the wunderdevice into a futuristic interface for just about anything. Are we the only ones who think this might be a bad idea? Applications like auto-surveillance or voice activation raises a few questions about their practical application. As Nilay Patel over at the Verge <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013935/open-company/nba-draft-pick-victor-oladipo-says-google-glass-might-be-the-future-of-news" target="_self">rightly said in this piece</a>, "It just doesn’t add value to your everyday life.” But could it add a little <em>danger</em>?</p>

<p>Take GlassTesla, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-google-glass-app-20130702%2C0%2C3919583.story" target="_blank">free app released last week</a> to ease the rough edges of electric car ownership. Users can monitor their Tesla’s location, check the car’s remaining charge and range, and remotely queue up the AC to pre-cool while it’s still charging in the garage. GlassTesla’s designer, 24-year-old Sahas Katta, is ominously dreaming of the day when the app lets users drive their Teslas by voice command--a script for vehicular-manslaughter-by-app-hijacking if I ever saw one. But more nefarious is the Midnight Honker, the Range/Remaining Battery Misleader, or the dreaded Kill Battery By Remote AC Drain. Cursed is the victim who finds a dead battery, a frigid interior, and a cackling tormentor who dooms hapless Tesla owners to hours waiting for a mobile jump.</p>

<p>Regretfully, the list of dangerous apps increases by the day. For example, <a href="http://glass-apps.org/ice-breaker-google-glass-game" target="_blank">Ice Breaker</a>: This meet-and-greet social app matches you with someone else (yeah, yeah) and then directs you to meet them (wait, IRL?) and have a conversation (heresy!) before snapping a pic and uploading it for a score boost. Then you separate to break further ice with other users, thus expanding the benevolent Platonic chain. Folks, this spread of amiable interactions threatens the very nature of Tindr- and Grindr-based hook-up culture we’ve worked so hard to build! Ice Breaker establishes a beachhead for simple nearby interactions on a friendly level. You will crave the day when friendship was totally off the table, I guarantee it!</p>

<p>And then there are the subtle disasters, the apps masquerading as “solutions.” As <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/20/4339446/google-glass-apps-everything-you-can-do-right-now" target="_blank">the Verge points out</a>, verbal commands are much more forgiving than the Glass’s very sensitive touchpad, foreshadowing a world of coffee shops and sidewalks plagued by one-sided conversations. One solution? A potential feature in a future version of the MyGlass app that <a href="http://glass-apps.org/google-glass-controlled-by-winking" target="_blank">introduces a “wink” command</a>. On paper, developing another “button” so early will hopefully prevent the backlash that Apple felt with its “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_USB_Mouse" target="_blank">hockey puck</a>” iMac mouse. Instead, we’ll get eerily silent rooms of digital cattle winking into the ceiling in order to avoid errant eye-twitches accidentally photographing other patrons.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are the hacks, like programming the Glass to “<a href="http://glass-apps.org/google-glass-ar-drone" target="_blank">fly a camera enabled quadcopter around burning man</a>.” Developing drone synchronization with Glass seems like a one-way ticket to one-man armies (though they may be suitable counters to hacked and rampaging Teslas): Suddenly, buzzing a quadcopter strapped with a high-yield “love package” doesn’t sound all that friendly.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Google Glass might streamline our lives in some places--take <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013935/open-company/nba-draft-pick-victor-oladipo-says-google-glass-might-be-the-future-of-news" target="_self">first person journalism, for example</a>--and introduce new and socially complex conundrums in others.</p>
