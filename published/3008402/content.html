<p>Ever considered what’s inside that slab of glass that’s your smartphone? Behind the super-thin, ultra-sensitive touchscreen of unbelievably-hard aluminosilicate glass, it’s densely crammed with 21st-century techno-wizardry--incredibly low-power chips, surprisingly-capable digital camera with flash, ever-smaller and longer-lasting Li-ion batteries, plus Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, GPS, Compass, motion detectors, audio, and a button. To put so much inside that precision-machined case required advances in physics, opto-electronics, electrical engineering, materials science, chemistry, and imaging. To make it useable, there’s an efficient mobile operating system and a brilliantly-simple touch-controlled interface between your finger and all those goodies.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of stuff to make such a smart device. But sometimes, it’s a lot more smarts than we need. There are times when simpler, cheaper, tougher, something with all the wires and plumbing exposed that let’s us get our hands dirty is the right stuff. Let’s hack!</p>

<p>We're narrating the development of devices, people or projects that hack smart <em>things</em> into clever, creative new applications--or which hack dumb things to be smarter. Whether fabricated, found, and or mass-produced, these will never be your standard <em>i-devices</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/05/tech/innovation/jay-silver-makey/index.html" target="_blank">Jay Silver</a> was recently described by CNN as "A leading proponent of the <em>maker movement</em>" He has a PhD from MIT, so we assume he's smart, but CNN was more taken with Silver's sense of joy and his abandonment of overly logical "information and efficiency." Instead what we're supposed to wonder about is "how to control a computer with a banana."</p>

<p>You think he's kidding, but for $50 you can buy Silver's <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com" target="_blank">MaKey MaKey—An Invention Kit for Everyone</a>, which he co-developed with Eric Rosenbaum (both are final-year PhD students at the MIT Media Lab's, Lifelong Kindergarten Group):</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joylabs/makey-makey-an-invention-kit-for-everyone" target="_blank">Funded by Kickstarter</a> (they set a goal of $25,000 and raised $568,000), the simple electronic kit contains a circuit board, alligator clips and USB cables and helps anyone turn everyday objects into touchpads that can be used to interact with a computer. People clamp the alligator clips to an object and then connect them through the kit to their computer. Touching the object produces a tiny electrical connection, which the computer interprets as a keystroke or the movement of a mouse.</p></blockquote>

<p>It looks like a toy and all the material is playfully-designed, but it's meant to be a serious learning tool. Here's what the site says: <blockquote><p>MaKey MaKey is an invention kit for the 21st century. Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything in between.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>For engineers, it's also a pretty good prototyping tool for tinkering with ideas and testing early-stage design concepts. As Silver notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Some people are just totally goofing around (with the kits). Some people are making devices so that their son with cerebral palsy can access browsing the web. I don't know which of those two things actually are more important. They're both, to me, really valuable."</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>There's a new common language for <em>Internet of Things</em> devices to chatter about.</strong> The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT) is backed by a consortium of companies, including heavyweights like Cisco and IBM, would like Internet of Things devices to communicate with each other. MQTT is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/a-messenger-for-the-internet-of-things/?partner=socialflow&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimesbusiness" target="_blank">being officially introduced today</a> as an open standard through Oasis, an international standards organization that says its mission is to create "interoperable industry specifications based on public standards such as XML and SGML."</p>

<p>MQTT is more or less intended to be the same for net-connected dumb devices as HTTP is for servers and browsers on the Net. British-based co-inventor Andy Stanford-Clark is a distinguished engineer at IBM, and MQTT's roots stem from his own efforts at home automation. It's been in development since 1998 and already has some sound industry support: Facebook <a href="http://mqtt.org/wiki/doku.php/mqtt_on_ios" target="_blank">credits the system</a> in its native iOS app and its Messenger app.</p>

<p>Writing about MQTT the <em>New York Times</em> quotes Ford's director of application development Vijay Sankaran talking about connectivity issues in the Focus Electric vehicle. Ford's servers need data from the cars in use to refine future product designs, and drivers may need to carry out connected activities while they're on the road: "You need an advanced messaging engine for these kinds of services", notes Vijay.</p>

<p>Oasis' <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/call-for-participation-message-queuing-telemetry-transport-mqtt-tc" target="_blank">website notes</a> that the formation of the MQTT Technical Committee is to:</p>

<blockquote><p>define an open publish/subscribe protocol for telemetry messaging designed to be open, simple, lightweight, and suited for use in constrained networks and multi-platform environments.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reasons for pushing MQTT are several:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many industries are seeing rapid demand for products and solutions which map physical world events into digital events for enterprise and Web applications, bringing an inherent need to integrate sensors, actuators and other types of devices with a wide range of application middleware and Web programming models.</p></blockquote>

<p>This quite clearly sets out MQTT's aims: It's all about getting devices designed for different tasks from different manufacturers, possibly lacking reliable connectivity, to talk to each other meaningfully and without adding too much compute complexity. It's a brave move, but the <em>Times</em> closes by highlighting that Oasis "is heavy on information technology companies rather than industrial technology heavyweights"--companies such as GE, which makes "dumb" connected devices like jet engines.</p>
