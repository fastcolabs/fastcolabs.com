<p>The gleaming slab of glass and electronics that's your smartphone is something that you take horribly for granted. After all, it's crammed with so much 21st-century stuff--incredible low-power chips, radio frequency physics, optoelectronics, precision machining, battery chemistry, and sublime user interface design--that it should probably be framed on your wall rather than sitting on a coffee-stained coaster on your desk. Nevertheless, it's precisely this synthesis of different technologies that we've come to see as actually symbolizing "smart devices." But sometimes you need something simpler, cheaper, tougher, or at least easier to open and disassemble.</p>

<p>We're narrating the development of devices, people or projects that hack smart "things" into clever, creative new applications--or which hack dumb things to be smarter. Whether fabricated, found, and or mass-produced, you can bet they don't bear a prefixed letter "i" or any of the pretense that comes with it.</p>

<p>"A leading proponent of the 'maker movement'" is how <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/05/tech/innovation/jay-silver-makey/index.html" target="_blank">CNN recently described</a> Jay Silver. With a PhD from MIT, Silver certainly has smarts of his own, but what CNN was more interested in was Silver's sense of joy and his abandonment of overly logical "information and efficiency." Instead what we're supposed to wonder about is "how to control a computer with a banana."</p>

<p>This is actually all about the MaKey MaKey Invention Kit  Silver co-developed with student Eric Rosenbaum while at MIT:</p>

<blockquote><p>Funded by Kickstarter (they set a goal of $25,000 and raised $568,000), the simple electronic kit contains a circuit board, alligator clips and usb cables and helps anyone turn everyday objects into touchpads that can be used to interact with a computer. People clamp the alligator clips to an object and then connect them through the kit to their computer. Touching the object produces a tiny electrical connection, which the computer interprets as a keystroke or the movement of a mouse.</p></blockquote>

<p>The point of the tech is that it lets folk hack anything from fruit to plants to control software. Though it seems like a toy, that can make it a powerful educational tool for introducing the concepts of circuitry and components, and it may even help engineers tinker with early-stage design concepts. As Silver notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Some people are just totally goofing around (with the kits). Some people are making devices so that their son with cerebral palsy can access browsing the web. I don't know which of those two things actually are more important. They're both, to me, really valuable."</p></blockquote>
