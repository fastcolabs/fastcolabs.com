<p>The gleaming slab of glass and electronics that's your smartphone is something that you take horribly for granted. After all, it's crammed with so much 21st-century stuff--incredible low-power chips, radio frequency physics, optoelectronics, precision machining, battery chemistry, and sublime user interface design--that it should probably be framed on your wall rather than sitting on a coffee-stained coaster on your desk. Nevertheless, it's precisely this synthesis of different technologies that we've come to see as actually symbolizing "smart devices." But sometimes you need something simpler, cheaper, tougher, or at least easier to open and disassemble.</p>

<h3><a name="This_story_is_tracking">This story is tracking:</a></h3></p>

<p>We're narrating the development of devices, people or projects that hack smart "things" into clever, creative new applications--or which hack dumb things to be smarter. Whether fabricated, found, and or mass-produced, you can bet they don't bear a prefixed letter "i" or any of the pretense that comes with it.</p>

<p>"A leading proponent of the 'maker movement'" is how <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/05/tech/innovation/jay-silver-makey/index.html" target="_blank">CNN recently described</a> Jay Silver. With a PhD from MIT, Silver certainly has smarts of his own, but what CNN was more interested in was Silver's sense of joy and his abandonment of overly logical "information and efficiency." Instead what we're supposed to wonder about is "how to control a computer with a banana."</p>

<p>This is actually all about the MaKey MaKey Invention Kit  Silver co-developed with student Eric Rosenbaum while at MIT:</p>

<blockquote><p>Funded by Kickstarter (they set a goal of $25,000 and raised $568,000), the simple electronic kit contains a circuit board, alligator clips and usb cables and helps anyone turn everyday objects into touchpads that can be used to interact with a computer. People clamp the alligator clips to an object and then connect them through the kit to their computer. Touching the object produces a tiny electrical connection, which the computer interprets as a keystroke or the movement of a mouse.</p></blockquote>

<p>The point of the tech is that it lets folk hack anything from fruit to plants to control software. Though it seems like a toy, that can make it a powerful educational tool for introducing the concepts of circuitry and components, and it may even help engineers tinker with early-stage design concepts. As Silver notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Some people are just totally goofing around (with the kits). Some people are making devices so that their son with cerebral palsy can access browsing the web. I don't know which of those two things actually are more important. They're both, to me, really valuable."</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>There's a new common language for Internet of Things devices to chatter.</strong> The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol, that's MQTT, is the way that a consortium of companies that includes heavyweights like Cisco Systems and IBM would like Internet of Things devices to communicate with each other. MQTT is <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/a-messenger-for-the-internet-of-things/?partner=socialflow&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimesbusiness" target="_blank">being officially introduced today</a> as an open standard through Oasis, an international standards organization that says its mission is to create "interoperable industry specifications based on public standards such as XML and SGML."</p>

<p>MQTT is more or less intended to be the same for net-connected dumb devices as HTTP is for servers and browsers on the Net. British-based co-inventor Andy Stanford-Clark is a distinguished engineer at IBM, and MQTT's roots stem from his own efforts at home automation. It's been in development since 1998 and already has some sound industry support: Facebook <a href="http://mqtt.org/wiki/doku.php/mqtt_on_ios" target="_blank">credits the system</a> in its native iOS app and its Messenger app.</p>

<p>Writing about MQTT the <em>New York Times</em> quotes Ford's director of application development Vijay Sankaran talking about connectivity issues in the Focus Electric vehicle. Ford's servers need data from the cars in use to refine future product designs, and drivers may need to carry out connected activities while they're on the road: "You need an advanced messaging engine for these kinds of services", notes Vijay.</p>

<p>Oasis' <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/call-for-participation-message-queuing-telemetry-transport-mqtt-tc" target="_blank">website notes</a> that the formation of the MQTT Technical Committee is to:</p>

<blockquote><p>define an open publish/subscribe protocol for telemetry messaging designed to be open, simple, lightweight, and suited for use in constrained networks and multi-platform environments.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reasons for pushing MQTT are that</p>

<blockquote><p>Many industries are seeing rapid demand for products and solutions which map physical world events into digital events for enterprise and Web applications, bringing an inherent need to integrate sensors, actuators and other types of devices with a wide range of application middleware and Web programming models.</p></blockquote>

<p>This quite clearly sets out MQTT's aims: It's all about getting devices designed for different tasks from different manufacturers, possibly lacking reliable connectivity, to talk to each other meaningfully and without adding too much compute complexity. It's a brave move, but the <em>Times</em> closes by highlighting that Oasis "is heavy on information technology companies rather than industrial technology heavyweights"--companies such as GE which makes "dumb" connected devices like jet engines.</p>
