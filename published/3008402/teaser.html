<p>The "Internet of things,” What are these "things" and what are they good for? We’re looking for “dumb things” to do stuff that “smarter things” can’t hack.

Plus we'll talk with the smartest people using dumb things to develop killer projects—what will it all mean for tomorrow's software developers?</p>
