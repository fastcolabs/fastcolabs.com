<p><strong>Ask people what device they use most often with their TV, and the answer will likely be “My remote control.”</strong> And indeed, since the 1980s remote controls have been synonymous with home televisions. However, they also seem to be the one device that could be holding engineers tasked with creating the television of the 21st century back from finding the best ways to interact with TVs of the future.</p>

<p>Engineers and design experts working on creating the first true smart TV need to get the notion of the remote control out of their mind. The remote control is a multi-buttoned monster of a relic that has had its day. It’s clunky, confusing, and 90% of the buttons on it are never pressed.</p>

<p>The remote control was good for its time, but trying to build a “remote control of the future” based off conceptions of a 30 year old device won’t lead anywhere. Think of it this way: In late 2006 when the rumors were pretty strong that Apple was set to unveil an iPhone, many people thought the device might resemble an iPod, but also have the functionality built into the scroll wheel to make phone calls. Pundits shouted that the rotary would once again rise up and take back the crown from the T9 pad. Other people imagined an advance Palm Pilot type of device with a stylus.</p>

<p>But neither of those things happened. What happened was Apple started from scratch--as if they had never seen a phone before -- and invented their own. And it ended up changing the computing world.</p>

<p>That’s what the handheld device (indeed, if there even is one) is going to have to be like in order to call a smart TV “smart.”</p>

<p>Writing for 9to5Mac, Dan DeSilva <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/20/logitech-announces-the-harmony-ultimate-hub-turns-any-iphone-into-a-full-fledged-universal-remote/" target="_blank">recently praised Logitech</a> for its newest Harmony Ultimate Hub “appcessory” that turns any smartphone into an ultimate remote:</p>

<blockquote><p>“For years harmony has been one of the most respected brands in remote technology.  It seems like the Ultimate Hub is a move in the right direction making this technology affordable for everyone. The Ultimate Hub will be available in the US and Europe in August 2013.”</p></blockquote>

<p>While he’s right that Logitech makes nice products and that it’s always a good thing when technology becomes cheaper because it speeds adoption, let’s stop praising companies for merely adapting old technology to fit slightly new standards, because a total rethinking is needed for the way a user will interact with a smart TV -- and it’s not the remote in any traditional sense.</p>

<p>So what’s the answer? Voice seems obvious. But as <a href="http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/tvs/1294504/smart-tv-remote-whos-works-and-whos-doesn-t" target="_blank">Tom Morgan writes for ExpertReviews</a> points out:</p>

<blockquote><p>“In theory, voice and motion control are ideal ways to interact with technology, but not in their current forms. Currently, voice-controlled TVs have a pre-programmed list of commands that must be uttered exactly in order to register a match. If the company hasn’t programmed an alternative phrasing, you’re limited to a single statement to perform simple actions that takes a mere button press on a traditional remote control. The limited degree of recognition accuracy also means that unless you speak with a BBC-trained English accent, there’s a good chance your command won’t get recognised even if you get the wording correct.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Could voice control be the “remote” of the 21st century? Sure. But as Morgan points out, the tech isn’t there...yet (but if I had to place my bets, Google will get there before Apple).</p>

<p>So what about gestures? My problem with gestures is that you run into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen#.22Gorilla_arm.22" target="_blank">gorilla arm syndrome</a> issue. “Gorilla arm syndrome” describes why touch screens don’t work well on vertical interfaces (like an iMac). Though the tech might be there, human anatomy still overpowers technological innovation. The fact is, we get tired holding our arms out in front of us (especially while sitting) and waving them around. It’s why we use our iPads in our laps and our iPhones held in our hands and don’t hang them on a wall like a painting.</p>

<p>But let’s say we could get around gorilla arm syndrome. Current gesture tech still has many flaws to overcome. As <a href="http://www.cnet.com/profile/katzmaier/" target="_blank">David Katzmaier</a> writes in his review of Samsung’s Smart Interaction control box for televisions:</p>

<blockquote><p>“The problem was, despite excellent lighting, my attempts to activate gesture control were often ignored and I ended up waving foolishly at the TV. When it did work, navigation was inexact and frustrating -- think of a coarse version of a Wii-mote -- and after a minute or so of it, my arm became tired. I guess that means gesture control is a good workout.

<p>My fist-to-click didn't register as often as it should have and I ended up flapping my hand open and closed repeatedly in an attempt to "click" an item on the screen. At this point, I seriously considered using my fist to do something else to the TV screen.”</p></blockquote></p>

<p>So, what’s the answer to the best way to interface with the smart TV of the future? I don’t know, which is why I’m tracking this story. If you’ve seen or are working on something that might revolutionize the way we interact with our TVs in the future, please tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgrothaus" target="_blank">@michaelgrothaus</a>. Because the world’s first true smart TV could have all the content deals it wants and have the slickest UI ever designed, but if it doesn’t have a novel, intuitive, and easy way to navigate it, it could very well be more of a pain to use than today’s TVs with their average of 60+ buttons per remote.</p>

<h4><a name="Apple_TV_Gets_Smarter_By_Borrowing_Popular_iOS_Apps">Apple TV Gets Smarter (By Borrowing Popular iOS Apps)</a></h4>

<p><strong>Apple doesn’t like rushing products out the door before they’re ready.</strong> However, that doesn’t mean the company is resting on its laurels. Indeed, today the company quietly rolled out the Apple TV 5.3 software update that brings more features to Apple’s set top box.</p>

<p>Significantly, today’s update shows that Apple thinks the road to a true smart television might be paved with features borrowed from iOS--most notably, some of its most popular apps. Now when Apple TV owners turn on their TV, they’ll be presented with new “channels” that are essentially ports of the iOS apps WatchESPN and HBO GO. Depending on what country the user is in, they may also see new channels from Sky News, Crunchyroll, and Qello.</p>

<p>Is third-party content important on a smart television? Of course. But not just any third-party content. To suck users into a world where smart TVs dominate, you need to lay a trail of bread crumbs made of the best content out there, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/19HBO-GO-WatchESPN-Come-to-Apple-TV.html" target="_blank">something Apple’s Eddy Cue seems to recognize</a>; he said this in a press release announcing the new channels:</p>

<blockquote><p>“HBO GO and WatchESPN are some of the most popular iOS apps and are sure to be huge hits on Apple TV. We continue to offer Apple TV users great new programming options, combined with access to all of the incredible content they can purchase from the iTunes Store.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the thing about these new Apple TV channels is that all but one (Sky News) requires an additional subscription to access (or you must already be a paying subscriber to that channel through your home cable plan). For people who want to truly cut the cord, it doesn’t seem to make much financial sense to get rid of the $50 a month traditional cable plan that offers hundreds of (okay, mostly unwatched) channels if every à la carte channel on a smart TV is going to cost between $4.99 and $11.99 a month.</p>

<p>But as Wilson Rothman <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/apple-tv-gets-hbo-go-watchespn-6C10378535" target="_blank">writes for NBC News</a>, that doesn’t matter--for now:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Regardless of the limitations, the news is welcome, not just to "Game of Thrones" fans eager to relive the crushing emotional blows of the Red Wedding, but to anybody wondering about the future of Apple TV. The more content deals Apple can ink up, the better the prospects for that elusive "iTV." If Apple can't do it up big--and that means getting contracts from most or all of Hollywood's biggest content stores--it will fall short. HBO is certainly a must-have these days, at least for premium-content bragging rights.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Still, the day a truly smart TV takes living rooms by storm, I don’t see it being one where I need to spend $60 a month to get access to 10 or fewer channels. Content is king, but for the most part, we live in a 99-cent economy as our app and song downloads clearly show, which means that, for now, the Apple TV needs to improve its learning curve before it can be called “smart.”</p>

<p><strong>Why We’re Tracking The Evolution of The Smart TV</strong></p>

<p>My ideal version of a perfect “smart TV” is this beautiful millimeter-thin pane of crystal clear glass that is invisible until it’s turned on. And once it is, it has access to every film, television show, and sporting event ever recorded--all through the cloud. It’s got apps and content galore. Further, its a two-way communication screen that allows me to talk to any of my friends and colleagues, no matter what device they are behind at the time. This perfect smart TV lets me navigate it by voice and hand gestures in the air. It’s my home assistant that can access any of my computer files--from emails to pictures to video games--from any device I own. And because this perfect smart TV contains every kind of media I could ever want access to, it has only a single cable that plugs it into an outlet. No other ports are on it because they’re no longer needed. External Blu-ray players, video game counsels, and DVRs are so early-21st-century.</p>

<p>But all this is just a fantasy in my head, of course. A true “smart television” doesn’t exist yet--no matter what the marketing material for existing offerings may say. Apple’s kinda sorta doing it with its Apple TV; Google did their version with the Nexus Q, which quickly went nowhere; and companies like Roku, Microsoft, and Sony think they’re on their way, too.</p>

<p>But no one’s there yet, because no firm definition exists of what makes a smart TV, well, “smart.” Is my vision of the ideal TV “smart?” Perhaps. Then again, I’m sure I’m leaving a lot out. And that’s what this tracker is for. Here, we’ll look at the latest advances in television OS’s, cloud services, and UI’s suited to the living room.</p>

<p>Don’t be mistaken: Smart TVs are coming. It’s just that we may have to go through many equivalents of the Palm Pilot until we reach something as refined as the iPhone 5.</p>

<p><em>If you’re interested in the evolution of the smart TV, be sure to follow this tracker. Here, we’ll explore the latest hardware and software advances that will one day get the television of the 21st century right.
