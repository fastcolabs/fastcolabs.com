<p>Department store H&amp;M has plans for a new type of commercial during February 2nd’s Super Bowl XLVIII: it will enable viewers to purchase H&amp;M items directly from their television set when they see the ad. With a touch of their remote control, viewers will be able to buy the same <a href="https://www.hm.com/gb/subdepartment/MEN?Nr=4294930476" target="_blank">Bodywear</a> products from David Beckham's Spring 2014 collection that they see during the 30 second Super Bowl spot.</p>

<p>The technology is decidedly less magical than it seems. We know because it's on display at this week’s <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/" target="_blank">2014 International Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) and while it's a great opportunity to engage customers directly from the couch, there are some acute limitations.</p>

<p>Delivery Agent, in which Samsung is an investor, has <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/delivery-agent-powers-the-first-shoppable-tv-commercial-bringing-t-commerce-to-life-at-ces-2014-2014-01-06?reflink=MW_news_stmp" target="_blank">a new commerce platform</a> whose major flaw is that it only works with a select number of Samsung TV sets manufactured in 2012 and 2013, severely limiting the retailer’s audience participation.</p>

<p>In fact, this limitation may be even more substantial than it seems, because some older models of Samsung TVs aren’t even equipped with Wi-Fi out of the box--they require an extra dongle sold separately. For a celebrity known for "bending it," Beckham's Samsung campaign sure has some inflexible hardware requirements.</p>
