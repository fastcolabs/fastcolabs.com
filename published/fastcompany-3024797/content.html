<p>On the anniversary of Aaron Swartz's death, Saturday January 11, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/on-the-anniversary-of-the-death-of-aaron-swartz-anonymous-hacks-mit-again/" target="_blank">hacktivists working under the banner of Anonymous breached MIT's site</a>. They replaced the page's content with a call to participate in the February 11th "<a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/" target="_blank">The Day We Fight Back</a>" protests against mass surveillance. A number of other highly publicized hacks also took place, though their veracity or connection to Swartz's death are unclear.</p>

<p>MIT was targeted because it <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2013/01/21/mit-actively-participated-in-aaron-swartz-prosecution/" target="_blank">actively pushed for an investigation</a> into the then-unknown hacker who downloaded articles en masse from the JSTOR database. The university initially portrayed itself as a reluctant participant in a government investigation.</p>

<p>Other hacks included an Anonymous-affiliated attack on Dropbox and a Syrian Electronic Army attack on Microsoft. It was <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/01/dropbox-goes-offline-reportedly-due-to-hacking-in-honor-of-aaron-swartz" target="_blank">initially reported</a> that Dropbox was DDoS by the group 1775 Sec and its database leaked. Then it became clear that <a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2014/01/13/dropbox-admits-hactivist-database-leak-was-a-hoax/" target="_blank">the leaked database was fake</a> and had been posted in order to trick journalists. Dropbox maintains that it was not the subject of a DDoS attack and that the outage was due to internal issues.</p>

<p>The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) took control of a few Microsoft Twitter handles, <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/01/11/syrian-electronic-army-hack-microsoft/" target="_blank">which it then told Mashable</a> was due to Microsoft supposedly "monitoring emails accounts and selling the data for the American intelligence and other governments." Despite the BBC's questionable decision to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25711832" target="_blank">prominently feature a picture of Aaron Swartz with their article</a>, there is no clear relationship between the SEA and the hacktivists commemorating Swartz. Indeed, one would venture to guess that Swartz would not be a fan of the hackers who support Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.</p>

<p>Swartz's role as a visionary for the open web and a political activist is perhaps too long to list. But some of his credits include being one of the cofounders of Reddit, helping to author the first RSS specification, <a href="https://twitter.com/HTTPSEverywhere/status/421913521329156096" target="_blank">writing the original version of the HTTPS everywhere browser extension</a>, cofounding the political advocacy group Demand Progress, and doing initial development on the open-source whistleblower submission system SecureDrop.</p>

<p>In addition to the hacks, a number of eloquent tributes to Aaron were posted over the weekend, including by <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/remembering-aaron-swartz-who-passed-away-one-year-ago-today" target="_blank">Trevor Timm</a> of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which took over developing SecureDrop after Swartz's death. Lawrence Lessig, the founder of Creative Commons and Swartz's mentor has begun a walk across New Hampshire to "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/10/lawrence-lessig-aaron-swa_n_4577917.html" target="_blank">fight the corrupting influence of money in politics</a>," an issue Swartz increasingly came to devote his time to.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, politicians seem to have not learned their lesson. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) is using the recent Target data breach to scaremonger Congress into <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/09/prosecutors-used-this-cybercrime-law-against-aaron-swartz-now-a-senator-wants-to-strengthen-it/" target="_blank">further bolstering the CFAA</a>, the "<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa" target="_blank">draconian</a>" law under which Aaron Swartz was prosecuted. And the Department of Justice has <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech/internet/a-year-later-doj-unable-to-answer-questions-over-swartz-s-death/article/365705" target="_blank">still not produced a satisfactory investigation</a> into Swartz's death.</p>
