<p><strong>Cue The Battle To (Somehow) Regulate 3-D-Printed Guns</strong></p>

<p>Well, this should make for a debate that’s as contentious as possible. Nearly a year after Defense Distributed first grabbed headlines with its plans to build a 3-D-printed gun, lawmakers are starting to freak out. Last week, a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57589294-76/3d-printed-guns-may-face-regulations-bans-in-new-york/" target="_blank">New York City council member introduced a law</a> that aims to outlaw the printing of any gun component unless one is a registered gunsmith. Under the law, any guns that are printed would need to be registered with authorities within 72 hours. The proposal comes a few weeks after a similar one was introduced in the New York state assembly. This is undoubtedly just the beginning.</p>

<p>The impossible-sounding nature of these laws highlights precisely why this issue is at once so terrifying and exciting to different camps of people. The same networks that empower everyday people to become publishers and share music freely now permit people to exchange blueprints for deadly weapons. To some, it’s an expansion of liberty. To others, it sends us down a dark and dangerous path. Like the sharing of MP3s, restricting this kind of activity will prove difficult, if not downright impossible. The quest to do so only grows more urgent as 3-D printing becomes more ubiquitous.</p>

<p>For those who haven’t followed the story, it broke into the mainstream last summer when <em>Forbes</em> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/08/23/wiki-weapon-project-aims-to-create-a-gun-anyone-can-3d-print-at-home/" target="_blank">covered Defense Distributed</a>, an organization dedicated to creating a 3-D-printable gun and making its CAD design blueprints freely available online. To do so, the organization launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money needed to buy a 3-D printer. They succeeded, but Stratasys, the 3-D printer manufacturer, <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/3d-gun-blocked/" target="_blank">quickly repossessed the device</a>, citing concerns over the legality of its intended use.</p>

<p>Cody Wilson, the 25-year-old founder of Defense Distributed, proceeded to develop the world’s first fully 3-D-printable gun anyway. A video of Wilson successfully firing his printable pistol, dubbed “The Liberator” were posted online in May, as were the CAD files needed for others to print the gun. The State Department <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/may/09/3d-printed-guns-plans-state-department" target="_blank">demanded that Wilson remove the files</a>, which he did, but not before 100,000 people had downloaded them. From here on out, limiting the spread of these files online will be about as easy as scrubbing the leak of Kanye West’s new album from the Internet. Indeed, as <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/23/govt-memo-warns-3d-printed-guns-may-be-impossible-to-stop/" target="_blank">an intelligence memo</a> from the Department of Homeland Security said of 3-D-gun blueprints, “limiting access may be impossible.”</p>

<p>Tracking: <strong>Inside 3-D Printing's Weird, Illicit, Dangerous Fringe</strong></p>

<p>Our ability to print things in three dimensions is, they say, the future. It's been around for several years, but this transformative technology is now getting cheap and fast enough for everyday consumers to utilize. The potential is undeniably enormous.</p>

<p>Yet for all the magical potential of 3-D printing, it also raises strange, illicit, and potentially troubling issues. The most obvious example is the 3-D-printed-gun controversy, which we'll follow closely as it heats up. There are also concerns over copyright infringement, a contentious issue that's only beginning to rear its head in the world of rapid 3-D prototyping.  What happens when millions of people are slowly granted the ability to produce 3-D objects at will? It's not unlike the Internet: Lots of awesome, radically transformative things will happen. Along with it, we'll get plenty of weirdness.</p>

<p>In this story tracker, we'll touch on everything from 3-D-printed food to sex toys and look at the social, legal, and ethical issues raised by this rapidly blossoming technology.</p>
