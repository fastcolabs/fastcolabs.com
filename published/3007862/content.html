<p>Most companies (this one included) divide their staff into "technology people" and "non-technology people." We think this divide creates real problems in the workplace. As technology becomes an inseparable part of business, not to mention daily life, everybody is becoming a "technology person." Many key decisions at all levels of companies now involve software, which means that everyone needs to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/talking-to-engineers/" target="_blank">learn how to talk to engineers</a>.</p>

<p>You might even learn from them. Software developers and designers are among the most productive workers in any office when things run smoothly, fixing problems and launching features at breakneck speed. But here's a dirty little secret: developers are also the laziest people at your company, and that isn't a bad thing. Unlike most professions, where output is additive, a good engineer will actually eliminate lines of code from a product over time by finding easier ways to solve problems. Having the discipline to constantly throw out your own work in order to save time requires a specific kind of laziness unique to the technology and design fields. How can you be both productive and lazy at the same time? We're glad you asked.</p>

<p><strong>Technology is not always the best solution,</strong> which isn't something you would expect engineers to be good at recognizing. But developers are lazy, and if there's a better way to solve a problem that doesn't require them to do any work, they'll usually go for it. On the other hand, an executive making a decision based on what scales better will almost always choose paying for technology over paying for people, even when it's the wrong decision. CD Baby founder Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/hi" target="_blank">summarizes this dilemma perfectly</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When everyone else is trying to automate everything, using a little human intervention can be a competitive advantage. The problem is when business owners see it as a cost, instead of an opportunity. Trying to minimize costs, instead of maximize income, quality, loyalty, happiness, connection, and all those other wonderful things that come from real human attention.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Breaking down complex problems into simpler parts often yields better results than trying to do it all at once.</strong> Take media startup Upworthy, for example. By some measures, Upworthy is the fastest-growing media website of all time, but they didn't get to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-upworthy-grew-to-104-million-monthly-readers-in-its-first-year-2013-3" target="_blank">10.4 million monthly unique visitors</a> by publishing the most content or developing a complex social media strategy or constantly staying ahead of the news cycle. Instead, the site has mastered viral media using a trick engineers have known about forever. Rather than trying to do everything at once, Upworthy broke down the functions of a media company into smaller goals and decided to initially focus on just one: Enticing surfers to visit a page on the site and click "share." Once they've perfected that process, they'll be able to build new features for a massive audience that most publishers trying to do everything at once can only dream of.</p>

<p><strong>The path to the best solution isn't always linear.</strong> Engineers at Fog Creek software knew they needed to support both GitHub and Mercurial in their Kiln version control software. The obvious answer was to build an options page and a wizard for conversion between the two systems. Instead, Fog Creek simply made Kiln <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2013/03/11.html" target="_blank">]work with both simultaneously</a>. The solution may seem obvious in retrospect, but it required a specific kind of lateral thinking that engineers are uniquely good at. Rather than getting bogged down in how to build dual support on top of their existing product, Fog Creek skipped right ahead to thinking about what the optimal solution would look like. The resulting product is far more "awesome" and useful than the usual approach would have been.</p>

<p><strong>Do what's necessary, not what's glamorous.</strong> That's the lesson from this <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/the-silent-partner" target="_blank">excellent profile of Twitter board member Jason Goldman</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Startups are run by people who do what's necessary at the time it's needed. A lot of time that's unglamorous work. A lot of times that's not heroic work. Is that heroic? Is that standing on a stage in a black turtleneck, in front of 20,000 people talking about the future of phones? No. But that's how companies are built. <br />
