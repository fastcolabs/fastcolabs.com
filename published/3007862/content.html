<h2><a name="No_You_Dont_Need_To_Learn_To_CodeJust_How_To_Think">No, You Don't Need To Learn To Code--Just How To Think</a></h2>

<p>Most companies (ours included) divide their staff into "technology people" and "non-technology people." I think this divide creates real problems in the workplace: As technology becomes an inseparable part of business, not to mention daily life, everybody is now a "technology person." Key decisions at all levels of companies now involve software, which means that everyone needs to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/talking-to-engineers/" target="_blank">learn how to talk to engineers</a>. And if you're going to talk to them, you should know how they think. You might even learn a thing or two.</p>

<p>Software developers and designers are among the most productive workers in any office when things run smoothly, fixing problems and launching features at breakneck speed. But here's a dirty little secret: developers are also the laziest people at your company, and that isn't a bad thing. Unlike most professions, where output is additive, a good engineer will actually eliminate lines of code from a product over time by finding easier ways to solve problems. Having the discipline to constantly throw out your own work in order to save time requires a specific kind of laziness unique to the technology and design fields. How can you be both productive and lazy at the same time? We're glad you asked.</p>

<h3><a name="Build_A_Simple_First_Version_With_People_Not_Code">Build A Simple First Version: With People, Not Code</a></h3>

<p><strong>Technology is not always the best solution, because technology is not always the simplest solution.</strong> That's a truism you might not expect from a software maker, but believe me, developers are lazy, and sometimes hiring an intern or two is easier than engineering a brittle automated solution. Still, we see time and again executives making decisions based on what scales better--before they've even reached scale! Thinking that machinery is always more "efficient," entrepreneurs seem to prefer paying for technology over paying for people, even when it's clearly an overly complex solution. CD Baby founder Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/hi" target="_blank">summarizes the dilemma perfectly</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When everyone else is trying to automate everything, using a little human intervention can be a competitive advantage. The problem is when business owners see wages as a cost instead of an opportunity. But people are the best cogs for version 0, because their workflow can change with a few simple directions. That lets you test and iterate quickly on the processes that power your business, validating the workflow you've set up without introducing tons of overhead. The result maximizes income, quality, loyalty, happiness, connection, and all those other wonderful things that come from real human attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Netflix and Amazon were both famously un-automated for years, employing human beings at folding tables to sort and send physical media. Here's Evan Baehr from Outbox, the Austin-based USPS-killer, talking about the value (and challenges) of constructing a human-powered software service--and then automating it once it congeals. From this <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3006776/open-company/dont-automate-lessons-hacks-powering-outbox-usps-killer" target="_self">FastCo.Labs launch story</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Last summer we met with Andy Rendich, the COO of Netflix. When Andy showed up at Netflix eight years ago, they were shipping 5,000 DVDs a day--these were DVDs in cardboard boxes and on folding tables they got at Sam's Club. Andy taught us how to do lean hardware development. And, like every other element of lean startup, we only automate or develop hardware for process bottlenecks. He showed up [at Netflix] and they had a 15-step process from intake to reshipment, all manual labor. He applied a rigorous evaluation process: How accurate is it when a human does this? What's the cost when a human does this? What's the expense of a hardware solution and what's the payback schedule? That meant a very high bar for automation. He has a nice anachronistic counsel: be slow to automate.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Breaking down complex problems into simpler parts is preferable to tackling a large schema of problems at once.</strong> There are no panaceas in software. Take media startup Upworthy as one example. By some measures, Upworthy is the fastest-growing media website of all time, but they didn't get to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-upworthy-grew-to-104-million-monthly-readers-in-its-first-year-2013-3" target="_blank">10.4 million monthly unique visitors</a> by publishing the most content or developing a complex social media strategy or constantly staying ahead of the news cycle.</p>

<p>But that's not some top-down strategy or hypothesis. Rather, the site has simply mastered a trick engineers have known about forever: rather than trying to do everything at once, break down the functions of your company into smaller goals. Then put those tasks in some logical order, and focus on one at a time. For Upworthy, job numero uno is enticing surfers to visit a page on the site.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to build a whole viral machine at once, they simply bit off the first problem: writing enticing headlines. Once they perfected that process with an ingenious (and non-automated!) workflow, they were able to focus on the placement of their sharing buttons, and other new features for their massive audience. This reductive approach is much less magical than you may think, which you can infer from the quizzical way they introduce their slideshow <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Upworthy/upworthy-10-ways-to-win-the-internets" target="_blank">on 10 ways to make viral content</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>You are dumb at the internet. You don't know what will go viral. We don't either. But we are slighter less dumber. So here's a bunch of stuff we learned that will help you be less dumb too.<br />

<p><strong>The path to the best solution isn't always linear.</strong> Engineers at Fog Creek software knew they needed to support both GitHub and Mercurial in their Kiln version control software. The obvious answer was to build an options page and a wizard for conversion between the two systems. Instead, Fog Creek simply made Kiln <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2013/03/11.html" target="_blank">work with both simultaneously</a>. The solution may seem obvious in retrospect, but it required a specific kind of lateral thinking that engineers are uniquely good at. Rather than getting bogged down in how to build dual support on top of their existing product, Fog Creek skipped right ahead to thinking about what the optimal solution would look like. The resulting product is far more "awesome" and useful than the usual approach would have been.</p>

<p><strong>Do what's necessary, not what's glamorous.</strong> That's the lesson from this <a href="http://bijansabet.com/post/46957258668/startups-are-run-by-people-who-do-whats-necessary" target="_blank"> excellent profile of Twitter board member Jason Goldman</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Startups are run by people who do what's necessary at the time it's needed. A lot of time that's unglamorous work. A lot of times that's not heroic work. Is that heroic? Is that standing on a stage in a black turtleneck, in front of 20,000 people talking about the future of phones? No. But that's how companies are built.</p></blockquote>
