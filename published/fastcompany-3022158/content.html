<p>Three-D modeling revolutionized the engineering world, allowing designers to view digital mockups of their vehicles (wheeled, waterborne, or aerodynamic) from any angle instead of a handful of perspective drawings--but engineers still need to create scaled-down prototypes to test for wind, friction, and other real-world conditions--a pricey process. But what if you didn’t need models at all? Researchers at the University of Bristol are boldly claiming that their new algorithmic technique will <em><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131119193912.htm" target="_blank">do away with physical prototypes entirely</a></em>.</p>

<p>This is critical not just for the expense--wind tunnels and other specialized environmental replicators are few and far between--but for the access this will give to smaller businesses and citizen engineers. Forget human-carrying vehicles: chopping down prototype and testing costs will make engineering any kind of product more affordable, from new quadcopters to impact-resistant internet-connected gadgets.</p>

<p>CAD/CAM 3D modeling has been around for around twenty years, but it’s been limited to linear modeling: if I’ve got a ruler hanging over the edge of a desk, I can measure the stress when I bend it in different directions. What I can’t measure are “impact” and other nonlinear tests, like how a model of landing gear deals with the impact of hitting the runway (and whether its structure will handle thousands of “cycles” of impacts in the landing gear’s lifetime).</p>

<p>I have it on good authority (that is, my father, an aerodynamicist with 30 years of experience for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing) that prototypes will always be a necessary step in the process. Which is obviously necessary when working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X" target="_blank">clandestine high-profile government projects</a> like his, but funders at any level require the assurance of tried ‘n true methods before they greenlight production.</p>

<p>What these new algorithms <em>will</em> do is allow anyone to digitally test the hell out of their design before creating a (hopefully) single prototype to confirm the digital model’s predictions. Again, this is big, even if you don’t need to create a massive vehicle: impact and nonlinear tests on startup-friendly devices will slash costs down to simple man-hours on computers. Power to the deskhounds and garage tinkerers!</p>
