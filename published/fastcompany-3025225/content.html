<p>In a post-privacy world, ephemeral messaging and encrypted conversations are becoming a <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/9/167154-ephemeral-data/fulltext" target="_blank">pervasive</a> communications trend that's likely going to stick around for a good long while, especially considering the flagrant omission of updated cybersecurity <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html?_r=0" target="_blank">recommendations</a> in President Obama's surveillance speech last Friday.</p>

<p>PingPal is a Swedish company that's been playing in this ephemeral communication arena for a few years now, but it has recently rolled out more of its promised features. It released a <a href="http://pingpal.io/2014/01/pingpal-chatapp-iphone/" target="_blank">chat app</a> for iPhone on January 10, mostly intended as a demo for the backend's partially realized potential. An off-the-record messaging service not dissimilar to <a href="http://gryphn.co/" target="_blank">Gryphn</a>, <a href="https://www.mywickr.com/en/index.php" target="_blank">Wickr</a>, <a href="https://silentcircle.com/" target="_blank">Silent Circle</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024643/this-new-app-wants-to-be-snapchat-for-grownup-professionals" target="_self">Confide</a>, or the grab bag of other messaging apps, PingPal has a lightweight interface for encrypted group chats.</p>

<p>But PingPal's API is its true utility, allowing anyone to build an ephemeral messaging app without re-inventing the wheel. For example, an Uber clone calld PingCab, developed during a PingPal hackathon, works the same way as the popular livery apps--except it wipes all the location and communication info after the passenger is dropped off, for privacy's sake.</p>

<p>A Platform as as Service or mobile Backend as a Service allows PingPal to do the backend heavy lifting for developers, ensuring impregnability and scalability for client apps and automating the self-destructing messaging feature. What's more, PingPal will offer VoIP and positioning dialogues for voice and location services. As much of this data as possible <a href="http://pingpal.io/features/#blockPrivacy" target="_blank">is kept off</a> of their servers, pushing the information directly to the recipient's phone instead.</p>

<p>PingPal is pushing itself as the ubiquitous enterprise solution for companies to build secure mobile and web apps off of; some sample code and additional documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/PingPal" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the PingPal <a href="http://pingpal.io/resources/documentation/" target="_blank">website</a>. It would like to <a href="http://pingpal.io/2014/01/ephemeral-messaging-for-privacy-protection/" target="_blank">thank the NSA</a> for its efforts to pioneer the way for a market like PingPal to exist in the first place.</p>
