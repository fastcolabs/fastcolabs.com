<p>The 3-D TV craze is dying. With top television maker Vizio’s <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/vizio-kicks-3d-tv-to-the-curb-teams-with-netflix-on-ultra-hd-tv-1201031076/" target="_blank">recent announcement</a> that it will discontinue support for the technology, and <a href="http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/espn-to-pull-plug-on-3d-sports-channel-1200495795/" target="_blank">last year’s decision</a> from ESPN to drop its 3-D channel due to limited interest, stereoscopic home entertainment is left without any major players in its corner. 3-D, it seems, has been abandoned entirely for the home theater’s new darling: Ultra HD.</p>

<p>In a pre-CES briefing last weekend, Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for the Consumer Electronics Association, said that he <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/05/up-to-150-ultra-hdtv-announcements-possible-at-ces/" target="_blank">expected up to 150 Ultra HDTV announcements</a> at this year’s show. Of course, adoption of the feature would be slow--being hot at a trade show doesn’t mean consumers will rush out in droves to upgrade--but DuBravac was optimistic about it because of 3-D TV, not in spite of it.</p>

<blockquote><p>"3-D TV has done really well," he said. "We've just stopped talking about it." He did point out, however, that most people aren't necessarily buying 3-D sets for their 3-D functionality. As a feature on higher-end and mid-range TVs, "consumers are adopting it by default."</p></blockquote>

<p>3-D television won our living rooms by attrition, but has done little to capitalize on it. Perhaps it’s because 3-D has almost always been novelty for novelty’s sake. The format has done little in cinema other than raise ticket prices, as few films implement it in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10435679/How-Gravity-changed-my-mind-about-3D.html" target="_blank">a way that improves the experience</a>. As such, 3-D viewing seems to be doomed to a cycle of dormancy and resurgence, <a href="http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/there-were-plans-for-3d-movies-even-before-there-were-t-511192939" target="_blank">one that began long before films even had sound</a>.</p>

<p>If the problem with 3-D is with its implementation and not the technology behind it, it remains unlikely that improvements to the tech will make it anything more than a forced add-on. But the technology still marches onward: Today both <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/sharp-8k-glasses-free-3d-display/" target="_blank">Sharp</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/markets/news/Marvel%2BDigital%2BFeatures%2BUltra%2BGlasses%2BFree%2B2014/9362672/story.html" target="_blank">Marvel Digital</a> are teasing TVs that merge glasses-free 3-D--the holy grail of 3-D tech--and Ultra HD displays. Such a display could be breathtaking--or it could be another 3-D-capable device for which we leave the 3-D off on.</p>

<p>The fact remains that 3-D today operates on the same basic principle as it did in the early 1900s: Here is an image, and a method for tricking your eyes into believing that it recedes from or moves toward you. Now consider the rapidly improving <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/8/5286696/oculus-rift-crystal-cove-position-tracking-ces-hands-on" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a>, which is based on an <a href="http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/03/09/whatever-happened-to-virtual-reality/" target="_blank">idea we’ve had for a while</a> but lacked the means to achieve effectively until now.</p>

<p>That’s what we look for in our technology: Something that will take us to where we’ve never been before.</p>
