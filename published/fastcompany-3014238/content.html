<p>The PRISM frenzy has added significantly to a discussion that was already simmering about the level of security protection on messaging apps like Apple’s iMessage. These services are so easy to use that most consumers don’t think about who might have access to their data. But usually at minimum, the company providing the service can parse messages and conversations, and often advertisers or investors have some access as well. But a desire to take advantage of now-basic digital communication should not preclude users from privacy, right? And probably anyone planning a bank heist knows about these security holes.</p>

<p>Peter Sunde’s <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014096/this-super-secure-messaging-system-is-the-nsas-worst-nightmare" target="_self">new messaging app, Hemlis</a>, promises to emulate the ease-of-use that makes messaging apps so popular, while also offering total anonymity from a data perspective. The company is saying that it won’t sell ads or user data and the plan is to fund Hemlis through donations and paid premium features.</p>

<blockquote><p>All communications on today’s networks are being monitored by government agencies and private companies . . . That’s why we decided to build a messaging platform where no one can spy on you, not even us.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the question is, what security strategies will Hemlis use? Because the extent of its security features will, at least in part, dictate who uses it. And how much shady business can be conducted over it. A lot of companies claim that messages sent via their apps live in encrypted fortresses. Even services with lousy track records, like iMessage, <a href="http://www.apple.com/apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy/" target="_blank">are touted as secure</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Conversations which take place over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can see or read them. Apple cannot decrypt that data.</p></blockquote>

<p>But just by taking a moment to think about how iMessage works, it’s clear that Apple is full of it. Messages must be somehow accessible if conversation histories are saved in iCloud for easy restoration on new devices, and if users have continuous, uninterrupted access to those histories even after they change their handset or iCloud password. These concerns were <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/06/can-apple-read-your-imessages.html" target="_blank">clearly outlined in a blog post</a> by Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green a few weeks ago. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>That's the problem with iMessage: Users don't suffer enough. The service is almost magically easy to use, which means Apple has made tradeoffs--or more accurately, they've chosen a particular balance between usability and security. And while there's nothing wrong with trade-offs, the <em>particulars of their choices</em> make a big difference when it comes to your privacy.</p></blockquote>

<p>These trade-offs are the crucial dictator for how a messaging service can be used for sensitive communication. If message histories are saved, even locally, the messages themselves are not secure. They can only function as such if their abstract meaning is transient and will not be useful to a later reader. A messaging system that works like SnapChat may sound like a better alternative, but it would run into similar issues between utilities that autosave received communications and the ubiquity of devices capable of taking screencaps.</p>

<p>No matter how sweeping a company’s privacy statements, they always seem to turn out bogus. For example, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9963028-38.html" target="_blank">in 2008 Skype claimed</a> that it could not tap users’ calls no matter what entity (private, government, etc.) requested data. Jennifer Caukin, Skype's then-director of corporate communications said, “Because of Skype's peer-to-peer architecture and encryption techniques, Skype would not be able to comply with such a request.” But it turns out that this was never true, or at least wasn’t true by 2010 when a pre-Microsoft Skype signed on to provide the audio from calls for PRISM.</p>

<p>If Hemlis can deliver on its lofty privacy goals there will be no reason to use any other messaging app on principle. But it seems like the only way for a service like Hemlis to be trusted for intensely private communication is for its backend to be totally open to scrutiny and evaluation. Without complete transparency, it will just be another black box into which people subtly allude to tax fraud, unwisely share their bank PIN, or correspond with their pot dealer.</p>

<p>People’s lives and decisions are complicated. And the more they live them online the more ambiguity they introduce. But we’re not here to judge. This Bad Internet tracking story looks at offbeat or fringe Internet practices and people who are just trying to do a thing online. It explores the black hat spectrum, everything from scraping to vulnerability exploitation, and highlights utilities that could have both legitimate and dastardly functions.</p>
