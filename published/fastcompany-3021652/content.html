<p>Smartphones only become obsolete because the manufacturers design them to. Motorola’s tenuous partnership with <a href="https://phonebloks.com/" target="_blank">Phonebloks</a> and its own <a href="http://motorola-blog.blogspot.com/2013/10/goodbye-sticky-hello-ara.html" target="_blank">Project Ara</a> are nice concessions, but too little, too late for users who want true modifiable open-source smartphones. Their answer has come: the Neo900, an open-source phone built out of the tried-and-true sliding Nokia N900.</p>

<p>What is it? A phone whose guts you can mess around with and upgrade to your specifications. What isn’t it? The most powerful smartphone on the market, which the creators admit--but they’re willing to bet that their laundry list of features will convince you to switch, even if it means trading in iOS for something with a physical keyboard.</p>

<p>The Neo900 builds off the <a href="http://www.openphoenux.org/" target="_blank">OpenPhoenux</a> project for open-source phones (who are so committed to avoiding “big data” that their only social media broadcast is through a <a href="http://lists.openphoenux.org/mailman/listinfo/community" target="_blank">mailing list</a>). Like the other OpenPhoenux phones, the Neo900 just replaces the PCB guts of an old phone (Nokia N900) with a laundry list of current tech. When that gets outdated, just buy new boards. Simple.</p>

<p>Along with the expected sensor suite (RFID, accelerometer, and both GPS and the Russian GLONASS), the Neo900 has an LTE modem--a forward-thinking decision that puts the Neo900’s connection on par <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2426637%2C00.asp" target="_blank">with only two other chipmakers equipping their modems with LTE: Intel and Qualcomm</a>. Best of all, the Neo900 supports all operating systems available for the established <a href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/" target="_blank">GTA04 motherboard</a>--which has no locks in bootloader or its kernel.</p>

<p>Currently, the Neo900 is still in the <a href="https://shop.goldelico.com/wiki.php?page=Neo900" target="_blank">crowdfunding stage</a>, but it already raised €35,100. From there, each threshold of orders for a ship-complete-to-your-door Neo900 reduces cost per unit: The Neo900 motherboard is expected to cost €500-€700. Open-source aficionados kvetching about Apple’s/Google’s chains, now’s the chance to put your money where your mouth is.</p>
