<p>Microcontrollers may be the bee’s knees of approachable and accessible modular computing, but they’re still chained to wall outlets or external battery packs. Enter <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/386717175/sodaq-a-lego-like-plug-in-rapid-prototyping-board" target="_blank">the open source SODAQ</a> (<strong>SO</strong>lar <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>A</strong>c<strong>Q</strong>uisition)--which, as its name suggests, runs on solar power, allowing you to build all those weird 'n wacky sensor units completely off the grid. Bonus? Its Lego-style clickable add-ons mean you can build off this thing with zero soldering know-how.</p>

<p>With a solar cell plugged into its dedicated socket, SODAQ claims to draw 100 times less power to connect things than an equivalently sized Raspberry Pi, so your Pi-sized projects will be much easier to deploy in the wild yonder. To relay data, the SODAQ comes with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS" target="_blank">GPRS</a> module that plugs into the board’s <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Bee_Socket" target="_blank">Bee socket</a>, which can also fit Wi-Fi/RF/Xbee data transmission modules. The team even mentions testing with a satellite modem hookup--how’s that for mobile?</p>

<p>To round out this modularity powerhouse, the SODAQ dispensed with breadboard/solder-dependent pins in favor of <em>12</em> Grove modules, which is as plug-n-play as you can get for microcontrollers (and there are <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GROVE_System" target="_blank">tons of Grove modules</a> to choose from!). The SODAQ has 16 MB of flash memory, plus a real-time clock, plus a microUSB port to import your code--and aside from the external solar cell (0.5W included, but supports up to 2.5W) and battery, the board itself fits into any existing Raspberry Pi case.</p>

<p>The SODAQ team’s Kickstarter is a quarter of the way toward its £21,000/$34,000 goal, but once funded, they’ve pledged to make their code open source and put it up on <a href="https://github.com/SodaqMoja" target="_blank">their GitHub repository</a>. Open source? Check. Power self-sufficiency? Check. Portability/ruggedness? Check. This looks like the answer to a lot of mobile teams’ prayers.</p>
