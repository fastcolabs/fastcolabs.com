<p>There are two ways to make money on the web. You can buy and sell stuff--also known as "e-commerce," ala Amazon or eBay. Or you can sell ads--the chosen profit engine for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Spotify, Youtube, Buzzfeed, Yelp, OKCupid, Howaboutwe, Tumblr, Yahoo, Netflix, and Hulu. For an individual person just trying to make some scratch, both these options are high-overhead with an exceptionally steep learning curve.<br />
 <br />
But there's something unfair here, according to entrepreneur Claudio Gandelman: The users who create and share much of the content that the latter sites advertise against--that is, the people that provide all the data for the targeted ads that make these sites so profitable--never make a dime. The internet is the great disintermediator, says Gandelman, who formerly served as CEO of Match.com Latin America. And the next logical step is for the people to get paid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3014872/is-it-ok-for-companies-to-track-your-data-if-theyre-just-honest-about-it" target="_self">Selling your personal, demographic and activity data</a> to marketers (and other third parties) has been commonplace on the web since the early 1990s. Gendelman's startup <a href="http://www.teckler.com/en/home" target="_blank">Teckler,</a> which launched in May, works differently. On the surface it's a social media site for sharing and discovering text, audio, photos or video (coming soon), much like any other Facebook clone. But unlike a normal social network, which sells ads and data and keeps the cash, Teckler splits all its data-derived revenue 70-30 with users, much like Apple's App Store vigorish.</p>

<p>"I think it’s pretty fair that if people create content they should receive something, even if they're not big," says Gendelman. "They are the proprietors, so it’s fair that they should receive something for what they create."</p>

<p>As a busy CEO, Gandelman says, he didn't have time to write and market a book or even to maintain a blog regularly, but he still had thoughts to share occasionally--and why shouldn't he be paid for them? If he posted on Twitter or Facebook, he'd never see a dime.  And to earn a share of ad revenue through a network like <a href="http://blogher.com" target="_blank">Blogher</a> or a platform like Youtube, you must be a power user with a certain established audience already--an audience that requires you to keep up a demanding schedule of content creation. Teckler is a way for the amateur to still get a cut of the proceeds from his or her own brain, but without all the individual overhead of a monetizable social site like <a href="http://pheed.com" target="_blank">Pheed</a>.</p>

<p>Teckler and Pheed aren't the only startups with variations on this model; in fact, the established personal data site <a href="http://reputation.com" target="_blank">Reputation.com </a>has a more controversial idea. Founded as a way for people and businesses to scrub their online reputations, they've <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/517356/if-facebook-can-profit-from-your-data-why-cant-you/" target="_blank">announced</a> a new feature that will let users share selected tidbits of personal information-your income, or the make and model of your car--in exchange for perks, like discount offers or loyalty memberships. This kind of permission-based marketing has the potential to raise a lot of awareness about the data harvesting that companies are already doing, by asking them to pay for the peeking.</p>

<p>The emergence of these kinds of marketplaces was recently called for by no less a pundit than <a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/" target="_blank">Jaron Lanier</a>. His most recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451654960/?tag=saloncom08-20" target="_blank">Who Owns the Future?</a>, laments the way that the information economy has destroyed the livelihoods of musicians, authors, and (through globalization and automation) essentially the whole middle class.</p>

<p>Lanier proposes a system of universal micropayments, something like what the Swedish company <a href="http://flattr.com/" target="_blank">Flattr</a> has been doing, allowing people to be rewarded for providing useful information either through self-expression or just in the course of daily interactions. As the jacket copy puts it, "It is time for ordinary people to be rewarded for what they do and share on the web." That is, if users ever realize the true value of the assets they've sunk into Facebook and Twitter.</p>
