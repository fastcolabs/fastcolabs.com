<p>Sometimes we see a demonstration that makes us stare at the screen for minutes trying to figure out how a developer did it. Other times we find ourselves refreshing the page again and again to watch a delightful new trick. On very rare occasions, something comes along that feels like a giant leap forward for the craft of software. We're using this post to share our daily favorites and keep a log of the demos that made us change the way we think about software.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to 3D printers, we may be rapidly approaching a time when most physical objects have forkable source code.</strong> So it makes sense that GitHib, the most prominent host of open-source projects, is leading the way with <a href="https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing" target="_blank">a new viewer for STL files</a>, the most popular 3D CAD format of the maker community. The technology behind the viewer isn't particularly groundbreaking, but the combination of GitHub's popularity and the 3D printing projects already being tracked through the site's repositories makes this feel like a giant leap forward for the home fabrication movement. Plus, it's just really fun to browse through massive repos of STL files (<a href="https://github.com/eweinhoffer/Bike-Accessories" target="_blank">this is our favorite so far</a>) and actually see 3D versions of the objects they represent.</p>

<p><strong>After a couple of miles, us humans start to lose our sense of scale.</strong> Take, for example, interplanetary distances. At its closest, Mars floats <a href="http://www.space.com/16875-how-far-away-is-mars.html" target="_blank">about 35 million miles</a> from the Earth. Can you visualize that length? Of course not. To understand the distance in human terms, <a href="http://www.distancetomars.com/" target="_blank">try this demo</a>, which reduces the Earth to a 100-pixel-wide sphere and then flies you to Mars in your browser. After watching and scrolling through it a few times, you'll have a sense of just how far away the red planet really is (spoiler alert: it's not that close).</p>

<p><strong>How many hours have you wasted pulling data out of PDFs?</strong> Those days are over, <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-tabula/" target="_blank">thanks to Tabula</a>, a project from Knight-Mozilla Open News. The software is still a work in progress, but for anyone who works with government data, even this initial prototype will be a panacea. Check out the <a href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/" target="_blank">restricted demo</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jazzido/tabula" target="_blank">fork the project on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Native browser animation continues to amaze.</strong> For the <a href="http://js1k.com/" target="_blank">JS1K</a> competition, cellist and developer Grant Kot managed to cram <a href="http://grantkot.com/js1k/blobs" target="_blank">an HTML5 canvas simulation</a> of "soft body blobs, collisions between them, and collisions with a sinusoidal terrain" as well as mouse interaction into less than one kilobyte of JavaScript. It's one of the smoothest native browser demos we've seen, maintaining a good frame rate even after hundreds of blobs fall onto the screen. Considering it's just a bunch of squishy circles floating around, the demo is also deceptively entertaining to <a href="http://grantkot.com/js1k/blobs" target="_blank">watch and play with</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you had told me a week ago that native console-quality gaming was possible in the browser, I would have laughed.</strong> Today, I would be regretting it. Using a highly optimized subset of JavaScript called asm.js, the team at Mozilla worked with Epic Games to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/27/mozilla-is-unlocking-the-power-of-the-web-as-a-platform-for-gaming/" target="_blank">port its ubiquitous Unreal Engine to the browser</a>. The result was spectacular, as you can see in the above video.</p>
