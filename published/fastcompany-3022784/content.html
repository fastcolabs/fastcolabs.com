<p>At 17, James Whelton almost embarked on a life of crime. He had gained some notoriety for <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/ipod-nano-hack-could-enable-video-games/" target="_blank">hacking the latest iPod Nano</a> and came into contact with other hackers. “I fell into a few of the chatrooms and forums talking to people with botnets of over 20,000 computers,” says Whelton. “I almost went down a bad path.”</p>

<p>Like any community or gang, the appeal of peer approval can be strong in hacker groups. “Someone offered me $50 to create a fake Paypal login page which would send the name and password to them. I couldn't bring myself to send it,” he says. “When you get into those circles nothing that you do in real life matters to your social status. Hacking or defacing stuff is what you do to build up a name, particularly when you have no other outlets.”</p>

<p>Giving kids like himself another outlet is one of the reasons that Whelton started <a href="http://coderdojo.com/#zoom=3&amp;lat=48.9225&amp;lon=-35.15625&amp;layers=00B0T" target="_blank">CodeDojo</a>, a community of free coding clubs for kids, while he was still at school. There are now more than 250 CoderDojos in 27 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>CoderDojo is run entirely by volunteers. There is no fixed curriculum--the emphasis is on self-directed learning and using the skills of the local mentors--and it aims to provide an enjoyable, social environment for 5-17 year olds. Girls make up 40-60% of attendees at many dojos.</p>

<p>“All the kids who are there are self-selected,” says Whelton. “They come there because they want to not because they are forced there like the traditional classroom environment. We just give the canvas; the kids paint whatever they want.”</p>

<p>CoderDojo has often proved transformational for kids who are having a tough time at school and struggling to find their niche. Former students often become mentors themselves by the time they hit their teens.</p>

<p>“There are certain ideas and concepts that kids who are within a few years of each other can convey much better than we can,” says Whelton. ”The sense of community that it brings and the relationships that spawns is just a magnificent thing. The technology world is a bit crazy with vanity metrics. We have x amount of users. We have raised x amount of money. We are interested in impact metrics: kids that are doing interesting stuff, kids who are finding new solutions to problems.”</p>

<p>One of those kids is Harry Moran who at the age of 12, and within a few months of his first session at CoderDojo, published the game <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/tech-savvy-harry-the-worlds-youngest-app-maker-174275.html" target="_blank">PizzaBot</a> which displaced Angry Birds from the top of app stores in the U.K. and Ireland.</p>

<p>“I was always been interested in computers and technology but I had limited access to them,” says Moran. ”I was allowed 20 minutes a week but when I started CoderDojo my parents loosened up about that. Originally when I told them (Apple) I was 12 they didn't believe me, and they called my Dad and asked him. Then they deleted my developer account because I was supposed to be 18 or over, so I had to do it under my Mom's name.”</p>

<p>Now 14, <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/30931-14-year-old-harry-moran-is" target="_blank">Moran just published his second game RobotRun!</a> and teaches web and game development at the CoderDojo in Cork, Ireland.</p>

<p>CoderDojo is the place that the now 21-year-old Whelton wished existed when he was growing up in Ireland as a self-described socially inept, nerdy kid with learning difficulties. At the age of nine or ten, Whelton felt that he wasn’t really good at anything and didn’t fit into his inner-city, all-boys school. As a result, he spent a lot of time on his computer.</p>

<p>“Programming was more a means than an end for me,” says Whelton. “I found <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview" target="_blank">Windows MovieMaker</a> and I started making short animations. I had aspirations to get them up online so that anybody could see them. All of a sudden people were interested that I had a website, let alone the animations.”</p>

<p>Whelton took to spending hours after school at the local bookshop reading computer books he couldn’t afford to buy. At 12, he got the chance to attend a summer program for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Year" target="_blank">transition-year students</a> (an optional, vocational year between exam cycles in Irish high-schools) at University College Cork. His classmates were all 15 or 16.</p>

<p>“To me those guys in transition year were supercool. They showed me how to do fun stuff with technology like Javascript prompts to fool and mess with people on browsers. We went into Goth chat rooms with names like Rainbow and Sunflower. So I associated that social environment with people who were fun and doing cool stuff with technology.” The program also introduced him to more complex programming languages like C and pushed him to develop his skills further.</p>

<p>By the time Whelton progressed to high-school himself, he felt that he had finally found his place in the world. “I was the guy who could get past the blocks on the school computers to all the social networking sites,” he says.</p>

<p>“I was on a first-name basis with the IT guy since I kept messing around with the network. I was pulled out of classes several times by teachers to fix a computer issue. People were coming to me to jailbreak phones. I had a part-time job building websites. That became my thing.”</p>

<p>Whelton tried to start a computer club in his school, but there weren’t enough teachers available to supervise it so with the help of entrepreneur Bill Liao he launched the first CoderDojo in 2011. “We didn't set out to have a global movement. We wanted to create a single instance in Cork.” says Whelton.</p>

<p>But soon word spread to other parts of Ireland, and people wanted to start dojos elsewhere. “We want it to be an open and decentralized organisation. I went over and started one in Tokyo and ten spun out from there.” A hundred CoderDojos opened in the first year.</p>

<p>Whelton sees CoderDojo as more than just an enjoyable social environment in which kids can learn how to program. “Technology has too much in recent years become associated with capitalism,” he says.</p>

<p>“While it's nice to make money, technology can have a much further-reaching impact in a social sphere. To attain certain belts or badges, you have to build an app or web site for a charity or good cause. The kids who eventually come out will be kids who can program, but with a social conscience. I don't care about creating the next Mark Zuckerberg. I care about seeing kids going into medicine or politics or whatever they want to do, but having the ability to completely revolutionize that field through their skills.”</p>
