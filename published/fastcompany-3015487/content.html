<p>John Gruber’s <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/" target="_blank">78 Markdown apps</a>, it looks like Markdown is catching on. Even if consensus never forms around a specific implementation, the online world as a whole seems to be moving <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/02/bounding_asterisks" target="_blank">towards using simple mark up in mainstream writing to emphasize voice</a>, rather than traditional formatting.</p>

<p>In that spirit, we want your feedback. Do you use Markdown? Do you like the idea of it, but find something is keeping you from marking things, er, down? Cast your vote either in the comments or, better yet, on Twitter.</p>

<p>Tag your tweet with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23usemarkup&amp;src=typd&amp;mode=realtime" target="_blank">#usemarkdown</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dontusemarkup&amp;mode=realtime&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#dontusemarkdown</a> and share why.</p>
