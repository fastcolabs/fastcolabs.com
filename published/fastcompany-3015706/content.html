<p>A story in <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://reporterbrasil.org.br/2013/08/samsung-e-processada-em-r-250-milhoes-por-superexploracao/" target="_blank">ReporterBrasil</a> has revealed that a suit seeking some $110 million in damages has <a href="http://9to5google.com/2013/08/13/samsung-sued-for-110m-in-brazil-after-ministry-of-labor-finds-labor-rights-violations/" target="_blank">been filed against Samsung</a> in Brazil after two inspections of its factory in Manaus, which makes products from TVs to smartphones, revealed widespread abuses of worker's rights. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2013/samsung" target="_self">Samsung</a> sited its factory in the region due to large tax incentives designed to attract industry.</p>

<p>The inspections were official ones carried out by the Ministry of Labor and Employment, in May 2011 and again in May this year. The inspections revealed a number of infractions including workers being required to spend over 10 too 15 hours a day on foot without a break, and sometimes working up to 27 days in a row. Overly repetitive movements by workers on the construction line were said to have led to a huge number of medical complaints. Work environments were also incorrect, with tables at the wrong height and lacking chairs. The Ministry is quoted as saying Samsung simply doesn't "have the appropriate management of occupational health," and notes that when it requested relevant documentation Samsung refused to supply it. Samsung has responded by saying it will investigate.</p>

<p>Apple, Samsung's bitter rival in the mobile tech world, has long been targeted for <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3014988/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-iphone-factory-worker" target="_self">alleged worker abuses</a> in what are described as "its" factories in China, with Foxconn being the most well known contractor name in this case. In response to pressure, Apple committed to carrying out independent <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1563014/apples-supplier-responsibility-report-finds-underage-workers-falsified-documents-more" target="_self">inspections</a> of its suppliers to prevent abuses.</p>
