<p>We like the idea of experimenting with storytelling around here. We’ve tried it with <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3009577/open-company/this-is-what-happens-when-publishers-invest-in-long-stories" target="_self">slow live blogging</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013134/tracking/watch-as-we-hack-our-newsroom" target="_self">we’ve tried it with audio</a>. We’ve covered <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014670/weird-hologram-concerts-allow-k-pop-artists-to-transcend-space-time" target="_self">holographic K-pop concerts</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3014624/why-new-york-startups-should-be-media-masters" target="_self">strategy for startup blogging</a>. So you can only imagine our intrigue when we came across something called <a href="http://codenamecygnus.com" target="_blank"><em>Codename Cygnus</em></a>--an interactive radio drama.</p>

<h3><a name="Choose_Your_Own_AdventureBy_Radio">Choose Your Own Adventure--By Radio</a></h3>

<p>Radio dramas recall images of Orson Welles stories being broadcast out to the masses in their living rooms, huddled around a cabinet-sized AM receiver. <em>Codename Cygnus</em> is technically a part of that tradition: Part casual game, part interactive audiobook, it’s immersive audio storytelling, lacquered in the delicious intrigue of an old-time spy drama.</p>

<p>In a world of ubiquitous Siri copycats, <em>Codename Cygnus</em> seems archetypal of a new way of storytelling--in which listeners become participants and the whole story is bespoke to the user. We’re all accustomed to interactivity on the web, but broadcast audio? That’s the original one-way medium. But not anymore. The benefits of immersive audio narrative--low overhead, portability, and a commute-friendly format--might be enough to make this style of gameplay stick.</p>

<p>Reactive Studios is banking on an experience that sits comfortably between button-mash gaming and passive audio entertainment. <a href="http://www.jonathonmyers.com" target="_blank">Jonathon Myers</a> is the game’s creator. Myers’ experience working on mobile games (along with playing his fair share on the T-line commute through Boston) got him thinking about an audio program that would be more immersive than the NPR stories we’re used to.</p>

<p>But what about the main character? How can you be fully immersed when the protagonist is (say) a burly hitman and you’re a teenage girl? In <em>Codename Cygnus</em>, gender pronouns directed toward the player are stricken from the game--in the main storyline, the player is always “The Agent.” Such subconscious reinforcement of the player’s imagination drives it further from the realm of audiobooks, but Reactive Studios didn’t stop there: In their fidelity to the spy genre, one of the most beloved tropes--mysterious, high-stakes romance--is prominently included, with players given the choice to become involved with whomever romantic options are germane to the plot.</p>

<p>“You can pursue who you want to pursue,” Myers says.</p>

<p>And, of course, the game was built around choice: try to talk the thug down or tackle him? Such choices affect both the story and the player’s stats: Myers describes it as “RPG-lite,” building the player’s character behind the scenes with zero bops or HUD indicators in the game’s quest to eliminate or streamline any UX mechanics that break immersion.</p>

<p>A narrative designer and writer with experience as a playwright, Myers pitched the idea for <em>Codename Cygnus</em> during a meeting of the <a href="http://" target="_blank"></a>, a roundtable for indie game designers. Not only did the idea have legs among his peers--they threw dollars in Myers’ face and told him to “make it now, take my money,” he says.</p>

<p>Myers conceived of the game after finding himself using his phone for entertainment during his commute. He preferred pick-up-and-play experiences with negligible learning curves. An audio-based adventure game would be one of the easiest, he figured.</p>

<p>Not many people are trying experiments like this one. Interactive narrative, as <em>Codename Cygnus</em> might be categorized, has slim pickings in today’s game market. The world is historically awash with text-based choose-your-own-adventure books, but Myers found precious few games that shared his team’s vision.</p>

<p>One ally was Dan Brainerd, whose choice-based progression in the Steam game <a href="http://www.dejobaan.com/monster/" target="_blank"><em>Monster Loves You</em></a> mirrored <em>Codename Cygnus</em>’s choose-your-own-adventure-style narrative flow. Still, the game was visually based--a different paradigm. Myers turned next to Naomi Alderman for inspiration, writer of <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com/" target="_blank"><em>Zombies, Run!</em></a>--an audio narrative-based game broken up into “missions” that pop up with updates between songs during your workout. <em>Codename Cygnus</em> will likely come with a few illustrations, but as it stands, the voices, choices, and the narrative will be the bulk of the gameplay experience. Once up to speed, they wish to put out a 15-20 minute episode per week.</p>

<p>The game will be available for episodic purchase in late August, and features voices like Logan Cunningham (narrator of <em>Bastion</em>) and Sarah Elmaleh (of <em>Skulls of the Shogun</em>). Reactive Studios has <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reactivestudios/codename-cygnus-an-interactive-radio-drama-for-ios" target="_blank">established a Kickstarter</a> to pay off the professional sound effects library, tech licenses, and plug-ins that made recording of the first episodes possible. Better music, voiceover brushups, and polish are also on the list. As of press time, the Kickstarter had reached one-third of its $11,000 target.</p>

<p>Even before this polish had been funded, Myers took a demo around at last March’s Game Developer’s conference. Wandering around the floor, Myers wrangled anyone he could to try the rough beta version of <em>Codename Cygnus</em>. At first, they were perplexed. And then he pressed play.</p>

<p>“When I put the headphones on their ears, I just saw this smile on their face,” Myers said.</p>
