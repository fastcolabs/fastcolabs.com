<p>Sony says it sold more than 4.2 million PlayStation 4 consoles in 2013, handily surpassing the "more than 3 million" Xbox One units Microsoft said it sold last year.</p>

<p>Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House announced the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/playstation4-ps4-global-cumulative-sales-surpass-42-million-239114161.html" target="_blank">sales numbers</a> Tuesday during his keynote address at CES, a day after Microsoft revealed the <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2014/01/xbox-one-january-thank-you" target="_blank">Xbox results</a>. The PS4 launched on Nov. 15, giving it a week's head start on the new Xbox, which first reached consumers on Nov. 22. Sony's console is also easier on the wallet: It carries a $399 sticker price, while the Xbox One retails for $499.</p>

<p>Consumers also bought more than 9.7 million games for the PS4, including the latest installments in the <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed</em> series, Sony says.</p>

<p>The system will soon offer streaming games through the new PlayStation Now service, which is slated to launch this summer, Sony <a href="http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2014/01/07/playstation-now-game-streaming-service-unveiled-at-ces/" target="_blank">announced</a> at CES. Cloud-based versions of PlayStation 3 games will be available to stream on PS4 and PS3 systems as well as on Sony's portable PlayStation Vita and new models of the company's Bravia TV line.</p>

<p>The PS4 is now available in 53 countries, compared to just 13 for the Xbox. Microsoft has said the Xbox <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/08/xbox-one-confirmed-markets" target="_blank">will become available</a> in additional countries throughout 2014 and said the system was, for a time in November, the fastest-selling console in the U.S.</p>

<p>"Since our launch, demand for Xbox One has been strong, selling out throughout the holidays at most retailers worldwide," <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2014/01/xbox-one-january-thank-you" target="_blank">wrote</a> Microsoft executive Yusuf Mehdi on the Xbox blog. "We are continuing to work hard to deliver additional consoles to retailers as fast as possible."</p>

<p>Nintendo, the third player in the console race, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2013/131030e.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> in an October financial statement that it had then sold 3.89 million Wii U consoles. The Wii U launched in November 2012 and retails for $299, offering less powerful hardware at a lower price than competing systems from Sony and Microsoft.</p>

<p>While that formula worked well for the original Wii, which ultimately <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1309.pdf" target="_blank">sold</a> more than 100 million units worldwide, it's proven less successful for the Wii U, which faces new competition from games on other low-powered devices like smartphones and tablets.</p>
