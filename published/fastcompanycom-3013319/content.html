<p><strong>Apple doesn’t like rushing products out the door before they’re ready.</strong> However, that doesn’t mean the company is resting on its laurels. Indeed, today the company quietly rolled out the Apple TV 5.3 software update that brings more features to Apple’s set top box.</p>

<p>Significantly, today’s update shows that Apple thinks the road to a true smart television might be paved with features borrowed from iOS--most notably, some of its most popular apps. Now when Apple TV owners turn on their TV, they’ll be presented with new “channels” that are essentially ports of the iOS apps WatchESPN and HBO GO. Depending on what country the user is in, they may also see new channels from Sky News, Crunchyroll, and Qello.</p>

<p>Is third-party content important on a smart television? Of course. But not just any third-party content. To suck users into a world where smart TVs dominate, you need to lay a trail of bread crumbs made of the best content out there, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/06/19HBO-GO-WatchESPN-Come-to-Apple-TV.html" target="_blank">something Apple’s Eddy Cue seems to recognize</a>; he said this in a press release announcing the new channels:</p>

<blockquote><p>“HBO GO and WatchESPN are some of the most popular iOS apps and are sure to be huge hits on Apple TV. We continue to offer Apple TV users great new programming options, combined with access to all of the incredible content they can purchase from the iTunes Store.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the thing about these new Apple TV channels is that all but one (Sky News) requires an additional subscription to access (or you must already be a paying subscriber to that channel through your home cable plan). For people who want to truly cut the cord, it doesn’t seem to make much financial sense to get rid of the $50 a month traditional cable plan that offers hundreds of (okay, mostly unwatched) channels if every à la carte channel on a smart TV is going to cost between $4.99 and $11.99 a month.</p>

<p>But as Wilson Rothman <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/apple-tv-gets-hbo-go-watchespn-6C10378535" target="_blank">writes for NBC News</a>, that doesn’t matter--for now:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Regardless of the limitations, the news is welcome, not just to "Game of Thrones" fans eager to relive the crushing emotional blows of the Red Wedding, but to anybody wondering about the future of Apple TV. The more content deals Apple can ink up, the better the prospects for that elusive "iTV." If Apple can't do it up big--and that means getting contracts from most or all of Hollywood's biggest content stores--it will fall short. HBO is certainly a must-have these days, at least for premium-content bragging rights.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Still, the day a truly smart TV takes living rooms by storm, I don’t see it being one where I need to spend $60 a month to get access to 10 or fewer channels. Content is king, but for the most part, we live in a 99-cent economy as our app and song downloads clearly show, which means that, for now, the Apple TV needs to improve its learning curve before it can be called “smart.”</p>

<p><strong>Why We’re Tracking The Evolution of The Smart TV</strong></p>

<p>My ideal version of a perfect “smart TV” is this beautiful millimeter-thin pane of crystal clear glass that is invisible until it’s turned on. And once it is, it has access to every film, television show, and sporting event ever recorded--all through the cloud. It’s got apps and content galore. Further, its a two-way communication screen that allows me to talk to any of my friends and colleagues, no matter what device they are behind at the time. This perfect smart TV lets me navigate it by voice and hand gestures in the air. It’s my home assistant that can access any of my computer files--from emails to pictures to video games--from any device I own. And because this perfect smart TV contains every kind of media I could ever want access to, it has only a single cable that plugs it into an outlet. No other ports are on it because they’re no longer needed. External Blu-ray players, video game counsels, and DVRs are so early-21st-century.</p>

<p>But all this is just a fantasy in my head, of course. A true “smart television” doesn’t exist yet--no matter what the marketing material for existing offerings may say. Apple’s kinda sorta doing it with its Apple TV; Google did their version with the Nexus Q, which quickly went nowhere; and companies like Roku, Microsoft, and Sony think they’re on their way, too.</p>

<p>But no one’s there yet, because no firm definition exists of what makes a smart TV, well, “smart.” Is my vision of the ideal TV “smart?” Perhaps. Then again, I’m sure I’m leaving a lot out. And that’s what this tracker is for. Here, we’ll look at the latest advances in television OS’s, cloud services, and UI’s suited to the living room.</p>

<p>Don’t be mistaken: Smart TVs are coming. It’s just that we may have to go through many equivalents of the Palm Pilot until we reach something as refined as the iPhone 5.</p>
