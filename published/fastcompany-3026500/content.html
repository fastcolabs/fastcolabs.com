<p>Your favorite basketball player is about to get one step closer to being a cyborg.</p>

<p>The NBA's Development League (D-League) will soon begin experimenting with wearable technology on the court, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2F2014%2Fnews%2F02%2F14%2Fnba-groundbreaking-devices%2F&amp;ei=wEb-UqerAcL4yQGRo4GIAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmkfcUrrIAyR7z0xI_GWDHdOAeXA&amp;sig2=fONpkIeDSiLCS0LDlhNEnA&amp;bvm=bv.61190604,d.aWc" target="_blank">league announced today</a>.  A small disc weighing in at a whopping one ounce--attached either to players' chests or between their shoulder blades and worn underneath their uniforms--measures vital biological statistics.</p>

<p>Developed in conjunction with <a href="http://www.stats.com/sportvu/sportvu.asp" target="_blank">STAT Sports</a>, <a href="http://www.catapultsports.com/" target="_blank">Catapult</a>, and Zephyr, this groundbreaking wearable tech makes available--in real time--individual players' current state and statistics. The information is relayed to coaching and medical staffs alike in an effort to improve players' efficiency and effectiveness on the court.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to help improve our players' performance and maximize their productivity on the court and help them live their dream of someday playing in the NBA," says D-League president Dan Reed.</p>

<p>By better understanding a player's cardiovascular and musculoskeletal status during games, the technology promises to quantify exertion in a number of categories including: acceleration and deceleration, jumping, distance, and direction run.</p>

<p>As of now, just two teams are known to be using these little buggers: the Bakersfield Jam and the Ft. Wayne Mad Ants, but the league hopes to expand well beyond that in the future, hopefully by the end of the season, a goal Reed likens to the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3022190/how-nbas-big-data-strategy-will-change-the-way-you-watch-basketball" target="_self">NBA's recent partnership with STATS VU and SAP</a>, and incoming commissioner Adam Silver's “commitment to the technological advancement of the league.”</p>
