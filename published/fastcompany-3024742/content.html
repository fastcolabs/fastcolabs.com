<p>It is pretty fair to say that physical keyboards no longer have the allure they once did. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/blackberry" target="_self">BlackBerry</a>, the last holdout of physical keyboards in their devices, has all but <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3024715/could-blackberrys-new-plan-make-us-all-look-like-fools" target="_self">outright admitted that its hardware is unsexy</a>. But, the company <a href="http://tactustechnology.com/" target="_blank">Tactus Technology</a> wants to change all that.</p>

<p>Tactus is producing magic-like hardware with "real physical buttons that dynamically appear and disappear into a flat touch screen," according to their website. A thin layer, composed of semi-elastic polymer, is placed atop a smartphone or tablet. Microfluidics enable the buttons to appear so you can type and/or play games on the device.</p>

<p>My first reaction when I watched the video above, was similar to that of the commenters on <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/10/transparent-physical-buttons-rise-up-from-touchscreen-on-demand/?utm_source=loopinsight.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+loopinsight%2FKqJb+(The+Loop)&amp;utm_content=FeedBurner" target="_blank">The Loop</a>'s site. It would be a successful tool for blind people if Tactus could incorporate Braille into the interface. After some thought, I'm pretty sure now that the technology will be marketed for a wider range of people and occasions.</p>

<p>For instance, consider that almost career-ending typo you emailed because your fat fingers couldn't tap the correct key on your touchscreen. Or maybe you sent a NSFW text to your mom by hitting the wrong button. Or worse, you tweeted a selfie that  definitely should not have been public. Touchscreen-typing mistakes are so terribly pedestrian these days. And Tactus' screen could be a serious remedy.</p>

<p>The product will initially come in the form of a smartphone or tablet screen-overlay, but Tactus hopes to partner with several companies to have devices with the technology built in sometime in the next few years.</p>
