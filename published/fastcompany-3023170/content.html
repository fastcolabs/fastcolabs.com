<p>Is tech education what the developing world needs? As the argument goes, what good is learning to code when water purification is still a fantasy? One answer has come from <a href="http://www.hackidemia.com/" target="_blank">HacKIDemia</a>’s <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/afrimakers" target="_blank">Afrimakers</a> project, a <a href="http://www.htxt.co.za/2013/12/04/hacking-for-kids-project-afrimakers-reaches-crowdfunding-milestone/" target="_blank">crowdsourced campaign to bring the "maker revolution" to the third world</a> via a kit of sensors, microcontrollers, and good ol’ fashioned scrappy programming.</p>

<p>Afrimakers wants its communities to take the program-donated box of goodies to “use and create extremely affordable technology for solving local challenges.” To that end, their goody box includes a range of sensors for detecting things like humidity, temperature, pulse, color, and carbon monoxide to hook up to Raspberry Pi and quartet of Arduinos in each kit. With a few breadboards for good measure, these sensors can monitor local conditions or be put on a wearable rig for LED-linked health monitors.</p>

<p>But Afrimakers doesn't just want to airdrop hardware components. Integral to the project's mission is the hands-on training to build “hubs” in seven African countries--Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt--intended to become regional tech education centers of their own after HacKIDemia trains local volunteers to become resource experts.</p>

<p>The kit-equipped hubs will host classroom workshops for kids to immerse themselves in the immediate-reward tangibility of maker tinkering--skills that will transfer to constructing gadgets and resource monitors that the Afrimakers founders hope will improve local quality of life.</p>

<p>The above video is from the Afrimakers pilot program in Nigeria. These 400 kids did much more than light up an LED with a potato. Their list of accomplishes includes building a waste-to-energy converter, DNA extractor, and robotic mini-backhoe constructor.</p>

<p>The Afrimakers <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/afrimakers" target="_blank">Indiegogo campaign</a> has raised $8,432 of its $50,000 goal--enough to fund two of the planned seven hubs, each of which will get two kits costing $1,000 apiece. Each hub’s team of volunteer experts has a self-financing campaign charging wealthier private schools for workshop classes, which in turn funds the free workshops that the teams bring to public schools.</p>

<p>It should be noted that HacKIDemia, the youth-maker-educating group behind Afrimakers, has been arranging accessible workshops for youth around the world since Summer 2012. With a <a href="http://www.hackidemia.com/mentors/" target="_blank">board of mentors</a> like astronaut Dan Berry, founder and director of Fundación Escuela Nueva Vicky Colbert, and Stanford lecturer of Entrepreneurship and Clean Energy Tony Seba, HacKIDemia has <a href="http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/hackidemia.map-hlrnrine/page.html#2/27.2/4.6" target="_blank">established 23 hubs on five continents</a>.</p>
