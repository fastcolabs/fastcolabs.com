<p><strong>A common thing I hear from serious gamers is that on no ecosystem Apple offers -- iOS nor OS X -- is gaming taken seriously by the Cupertino company.</strong> And until now, they may have been right. While there are some impressive games on iOS, they’re only impressive for a smartphone. When you compare them to a PC or console game, they lose their luster. The same goes for OS X, which still only gets the most popular PC games years after they have come out.</p>

<p>Part of this can be blamed on game developers. It cost millions of dollars to bring a game to a new platform, so those systems with smaller marketshare (like computers running OS X) aren’t going to get a lot of love. But who can really blame them? Game development is a business and if you can’t get a good return on your investment, there’s no point in wasting your time or money.</p>

<p>But another reason gaming, particularly on iOS, has been labeled nothing but “casual” -- something people do to waste time in a doctor’s office or on the commute home -- is because a smartphone like the iPhone doesn’t provide the right tactile experience for complex games.</p>

<p>To see what I mean by this, imagine playing Red Dead Redemption on an iPhone or iPad. A game like that has such complicated controls, they only work well with physical controllers. And it’s because those controllers exist in three dimensions we don’t need to look at the controls to make a character walk forward or duck. We can feel it with our fingertips, which means we can concentrate on what is going on onscreen and not having to constantly look under our thumbs to make sure our fingers are actually touching the d-pad.</p>

<p>But the days of fingertips slipping from a touchscreen d-pad are about to end thanks to the <a href="https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/wa/login?appIdKey=d4f7d769c2abecc664d0dadfed6a67f943442b5e9c87524d4587a95773750cea&amp;amp;path=%2F%2Flibrary%2Fprerelease%2Fios%2Fdocumentation%2FServicesDiscovery%2FConceptual%2FGameControllerPG%2FIntroduction%2FIntroduction.html" target="_blank">new Game Controller framework</a> Apple has just released in the iOS 7 beta (it’s also available for OS X 10.9). The framework sets the stage for third party game controller support that has Apple’s blessing to talk to iOS. The official support from Apple means that games are about to get much more advanced on iOS because it frees users from the flat touchscreen and gives them tactile controls like never before on an iPhone.</p>

<p>How big of a deal is this for gaming on iOS? Pretty big, <a href="http://www.techdigest.tv/2013/06/forget_xbox_one.html" target="_blank">according to Gerald Lynch of Tech Digest</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“On the surface it doesn't sound like a major deal - we've already had iOS gamepads from the likes of iCade and Ion. However, without any standardised API blueprint to work against, games developers had to put the effort in to optimising their titles for each manufacturer's unique hardware control system. For many games devs, it just wasn't worth the extra hassle to add support for a controller that only a few thousand people (at best) may own, especially when the iPhone and iPad's touch controls worked out fine. But with the introduction of a standardised API, whatever Apple-certified gamepad you buy going forward from the release of iOS 7 will adhere to a unified design, a single system that any game dev can easily add support for.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However, developers hoping to enhance their games with third-party controller support need to keep some things in mind. Even though Apple is now being more proactive in its approach to gaming, it’s still Apple after all, and it does impose some limitations on how the controllers can interface with iOS games. Here’s the one caveat from the iOS Developer Library notes devs should be aware of:</p>

<blockquote><p>“<strong>Controllers Must Be Optional:</strong> If you write a game that supports controllers, there must also be a way to play the game without a controller. On an iOS device, that means taking advantage of the touch screen and the integrated sensors in the device. On OS X, this usually means an interface based on the keyboard and mouse. Either way, controllers must enhance gameplay—they must not be required.”</p></blockquote>

<p>What this clause is really saying is iOS may be more open to gaming, but it’s still Apple’s ecosystem and not the developer’s. Apple doesn’t want the iPhone becoming a glorified gaming system -- like an Xbox mini -- because the device is so much more than that. And most importantly, it doesn’t want to piss off its users by making them think they aren’t getting all they can out of the iPhone without buying additional hardware.</p>

<p>And to me, that’s a smart move. If I see a game on the App Store, I want to be able to download it and use it like I can any non-gaming app -- right on my iPhone, using only my iPhone and fingers to interact with it. For game developers, however, that does mean extra work. Because if you can develop a kick ass game for iOS that users a controller, you also need to find out a way to make it work sans gamepad.</p>

<p>Apple owned the most popular platforms for software development in the 1980s with Mac OS and again in the late noughties with iOS. Now the company is set to go through another significant development boom with iOS 7 and OS X 10.9 and beyond. Where will these development changes take us? Some think they’ll lead to the unification of Mac OS and iOS. Some think they’ll lead to a third or even fourth development ecosystem -- one aimed at wearable tech and one aimed at smart televisions. Only time will tell where software development in Apple’s ecosystem leads, but right now there’s plenty of interesting new stuff going on in the existing ecosystems to keep developers busy.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in the future of development on Apple’s ecosystems, be sure to follow this tracker. Here we’ll explore the latest frameworks, tips, and advances in iOS and OS X.
