<p>Wearable computing is finally edging into the mainstream, but we don't necessarily like what we see. Sure, there's nothing wrong with “quantified self” devices like FitBit, Nike FuelBand, and the Jawbone UP, and we're just as curious as anyone about the reported <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000155522" target="_blank">smartwatch war brewing</a> between Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung.</p>

<p>But many of these gadgets look and feel predictable and kludgy. In the age of the “internet of things” they’re still held captive by the confines of the rectangular screen. When it comes to wearables, it’s not enough to slap a wristband on iOS and call it a smart watch. When the (and <a href="http://betabeat.com/2013/03/stop-the-cyborgs-begins-with-stopping-google-glass/" target="_blank">hotly debated</a>) Google Glass launches later this year, it will be a milestone product, separating people with a cyborg vision of the future from people who prefer their smart devices <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008323/tracking/your-apps-next-interface-tracking-spatial-controls-and-no-ui" target="_self">to have no UI at all</a>.</p>

<p>Designing objects meant to be worn by actual humans will need a new approach: A re-imagining of conventional clothing design principles, and the creation of products that are less intrusive and more responsive than what we're used to today. Most of all, these principles need to give way to devices that are elegant enough to appeal to more than just the geek squad.</p>

<p>With computing devices rapidly invading our closet, we’ll be following new developments in smart materials and wearable UI design. Mainstream adoption of wearable tech will require an unprecedented marriage of form and function--we’ll need products we can’t live without, wrapped in a package we can get comfortable living in. Simultaneously, we’ll examine how these wired devices introduce new behavioral norms, as well as pose new privacy concerns for both the wearer and those who come into contact with him or her.</p>

<p><strong>The last thing you need is another screen in your life.</strong> One of the great promises of wearables is their potential to help us transcend the screen, which dominates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/business/media/27adco.html" target="_blank">the majority of our waking hours.</a> Between TVs, computers, cell phones, and GPS devices, the average adult spends roughly 8.5 hours a day staring at a screen (and that’s according to 2009 data, so chances are that number’s even higher now).</p>

<p>With computing power embedded in everything from the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007681/open-company/why-clothing-next-frontier-responsive-computing" target="_self">fabric of your shirt</a> to the <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007681/open-company/why-clothing-next-frontier-responsive-computing" target="_self">shoes on your feet</a>, responsive design and gestural commands can help us spend less time interfacing with our technology and more time with the people around us. When your clothes are wirelessly connected to the web, you can check the weather, tweet, and check in on Foursquare without ever having to whip out your phone. Which is ostensibly great for eliminating the dreaded phone check over dinner, but only contributes to our overshared, “always on” culture by making this state even more passively ingrained than it already is.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>It’s not enough to cobble together a video camera, a phone, and a push-to-Facebook feature and call it innovation.</strong> That Frankenstein approach to design is what Frog Design’s Jan Chipchase says is “<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130412/you-lookin-at-me-reflections-on-google-glass/" target="_blank">a lazy futurist’s vision of what might be</a>”, citing Google’s Glass as an example. It’s as if technological innovation is following the blueprints laid out in science fiction and videogames. We’re creating the gizmos we fetishized as children.</p>

<blockquote><p>Take the trajectory of one product (displays becoming smaller/cheaper/more efficient over time) and integrate it with another (eyeglasses), sprinkle in connectivity and real-time access to content and big-data-analytics. Our expectations of what it could be are raised in part because this join-the-dots vision of the future fits neatly into Western un/popular young-male culture, from “The Terminator” through to Halo. Glass has a certain inevitability about it, like the weight of expectation on a child born to a great composer or, if you will, to a middle-aged suicide. </p></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to point out that, while the hardware in Glass and products like it is actually not incredibly revolutionary--at least, not when compared with some of the crazy shit they’ve got going on in Japan--Glass’s real opportunity is in creating a meaningful user experience through software design.</p>

<blockquote><p>As any visitor to <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/%E6%B6%B2%E6%99%B6%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E9%96%A2%E9%80%A3%E7%94%A8%E5%93%81/ct/35364_500000000000000212/" target="_blank">Yodobashi camera</a> over the past decade will tell you, the hardware technologies that make Glass hardly feel novel (and for recent competitors, see Sony, <a href="http://www.mygoldeni.com/home/" target="_blank">Golden-i</a>, or this <a href="http://tele-pathy.org/" target="_blank">Telepathy device prototype</a>) but neither do they need to be, because this is all about how they are brought together into a holistic experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may very well be that Glass is a necessary step for us to take before we can even begin to introduce devices like Telepathy into the fray. Anything too radically innovative is likely to shock the system. There’s a reason most products are only incremental variations on versions that came before. If you give people something they’ve truly never seen or experienced, you then face the uphill battle of training them to use the damn thing and getting them comfortable doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Is it wise to take pages from Apple's book?</strong> Companies like <a href="http://www.misfitwearables.com/" target="_blank">Misfit Wearables</a> are taking inspiration from Cupertino by defying every current convention in the wearable space. Their <a href="http://www.misfitwearables.com/shine" target="_blank">Shine</a>, which is a circular personal activity tracker about the size of a quarter, is the first wearable that’s all metal, doesn’t need to be charged, and can be worn any number of ways to accommodate a wide variety of users, including women, who were largely overlooked by the more male-centric designs of UP, FuelBand and FitBit. Simplicity is the priority--and an admirable one.</p>

<p>The team also developed what they’re calling a “<a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/08/wearable-design-misfit-and-the-age-of-the-glanceable-ui/" target="_blank">glanceable UI</a>” that’s designed for the more casual interactions users have with wearable devices, as opposed to a laptop or cell phone screen. Here's what they say about creating a wearable UI.</p>

<blockquote><p>A glanceable UI is about creating a second’s worth of meaning out of important and impactful data. Whether that’s a moment to convey how well you’re doing toward your daily fitness goal or a single blinking light to encourage more movement. As <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/26/why-data-without-a-soul-is-meaningless/" target="_blank">Om wrote recently</a>, as data becomes the world’s currency, data without emotion, empathy or narrative is meaningless. Wearable gadgets can track as much data as they want, but if the user isn’t exposed to the data in a way that impacts their lives, and in a time frame that they can work with, then the device has failed.</p></blockquote>

<p>While their instincts are correct--materials do make a difference and designing UI around the unique social context of wearables, which we interact with in a different way than we do with our phones, is equally as important--it’s also easy to be overly reductionist and simplify things to the point of trivialization. Exactly how much "emotion, empathy or narrative" can one glean from a blinking light?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Software and interaction design for these devices calls for a new paradigm of interaction that is more gestural, organic, and less intrusive than what we’ve become used to on screens.</strong> Fjord’s Andy Goodman and Marco Righetto <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671960/why-the-human-body-will-be-the-next-computer-interface" target="_self">imagine a new language of interaction altogether</a>, composed of micro gestures and expressions.</p>

<blockquote><p>The new language will be ultra subtle and totally intuitive, building not on crude body movements but on subtle expressions and micro-gestures. This is akin to the computer mouse and the screen. The Mac interface would never have worked if you needed to move the mouse the same distance as it moved on the screen. It would have been annoying and deeply unergonomic. This is the same for the gestural interface.

<p>Why swipe your arm when you can just rub your fingers together. What could be more natural than staring at something to select it, nodding to approve something? This is the world that will be possible when we have hundreds of tiny sensors mapping every movement, outside and within our bodies. For privacy, you’ll be able to use imperceptible movements, or even hidden ones such as flicking your tongue across your teeth.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The switch to a gesture-based language will involve both appropriating existing gestural behavior and introducing new micro-gestures that will become indoctrinated into the cultural language of wearables, just like the swipe, the double tap and the pinch to zoom were for smart phones.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Wearables present all kinds of new challenges for privacy</strong>--both the privacy of the wearer, whose every movement, breath and heartbeat is being tracked, as well as those in the wearer's vicinity. The majority of the discussion is presently centered around Google's Glass, since the embedded 5MP camera poses questions of <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130412/you-lookin-at-me-reflections-on-google-glass/" target="_blank">unwanted surveillance</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>As a product that is both on-your-face and in-your-face, Glass is set to become a lightning rod for a wider discussion around what constitutes acceptable behavior in public and private spaces. The Glass debate has already started, but these are early days; each new iteration of hardware and functionality will trigger fresh convulsions. In the short term, Glass will trigger anger, name-calling, ridicule and the occasional bucket of thrown water (whether it’s ice water, I don’t know). In the medium term, as societal interaction with the product broadens, signs will appear in public spaces guiding mis/use1 and lawsuits will fly, while over the longer term, legislation will create boundaries that reflect some form of im/balance between individual, corporate and societal wants, needs and concerns.</p></blockquote>

<p>But equally important as what the Google Glass wearer sitting across the table from you is doing with his or her camera right now is the question of what Google is doing with that information--or any other corporate entity. For as much as we have to fear from our fellow peers violating our privacy, we have even more cause for concern when it comes to the companies who make these products and own our user data misusing that information for financial gain. Just look at Facebook.</p>
