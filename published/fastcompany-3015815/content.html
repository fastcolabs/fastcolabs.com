<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2013/google" target="_self">Google</a> has been testing server-side encryption for a while, but a new posting on its <a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.pt/2013/08/google-cloud-storage-now-provides.html" target="_blank">Cloud blog today</a> has revealed something that sounds quite positive from a privacy/mess with the NSA/security point of view: It's enabling server-side encryption for free automatically for all content uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, and will slowly encrypt older files over time. Note the "sounds quite positive" phrase, however.</p>

<p>Every object uploaded to Cloud will have its data and metadata encrypted with a unique key using 128-bit AES. Each object's key is then encrypted with a "unique key associated with the object owner." As a slightly crazy-sounding third layer of encryption, the object owner's master keys are also "encrypted by one of a regularly rotated set of master keys."</p>

<p>Google explains that this move is going to be great for folks who require regular encryption of their data (perhaps to protect company secrets or manage sensitive user data that's still cloud-accessible). That because automatic encryption "frees you from the hassle and risk of managing your own encryption and decryption keys." How kind. Google even manages "the cryptographic keys on your behalf using the same hardened key management systems that Google uses for our own encrypted data, including strict key access controls and auditing."</p>

<p>The first thought you may be having here is that this is a great anti-hacking move, and you'd probably be right: The idea that a casual hacker, even one with access to pretty sophisticated gear, could crunch through all these layers of security is silly. But you may also be thinking this is one in the eye for government surveillance like the widespread snooping by the NSA and its affiliates--much of which takes place on data help by giant U.S. companies like Google, Apple, and so on. Before you go too far with that thought, read that line about Google managing "cryptographic keys on your behalf" again. Reflect on the recent revelations that Google's own lawyers think that Gmail users have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/14/google-gmail-users-privacy-email-lawsuit" target="_blank">no expectation of privacy</a>, and remember that Google may have to simply accede to legal surveillance requests...and thus hand over <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1838425/yahoo-accidentally-leaks-private-encryption-key-axis-its-new-search-system" target="_self">your encryption keys</a> on demand. Which means the data is actually no more secure from official surveillance than it was before, if you simply upload it in the raw.</p>

<p>Google does note that users are still free to "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3013346/nsa-cramping-your-style-use-these-easy-encryption-solutions" target="_self">encrypt data yourself</a> prior to writing it to Cloud Storage," where it will then automatically be encrypted again. That's one thing definitely worth making a note of.</p>
