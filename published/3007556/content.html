<p>People have <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/google-reader-death-may-aid-internet-censorship-say-oppressed-users-who-rely-rss-feed-1140473" target="_blank">blamed Google Plus</a> for outmoding Reader in the eyes of the company brass. Agonizing Reader fans further, <a href="http://bit.ly/YLmTnE" target="_blank">Google rather abruptly announces Keep</a>, an Evernote copycat which syncs with a new Notes app that will come stock on Android phones.</p>

<h5><a name="Alternatives">Alternatives</a></h5>

<p>After coming to terms with losing Reader, the focus of the conversation shifts to alternatives. Just one day after the announcement, social sharing platform Digg says <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3007030/tech-forecast/digg-building-its-own-top-priority-news-reader" target="_self">it is building a reader app</a>. Popular Google Reader client Feedly similarly <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3007111/creative-conversations/google-readers-loss-feedlys-gain-tune-500k-new-users" target="_self">assures users</a> that they had long prepared for Reader's demise and had already built a new backend for users that does not rely on Google. Slate runs an interactive graphic of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/map_of_the_week/2013/03/google_reader_joins_graveyard_of_dead_google_products.html" target="_blank">Google's product graveyard</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="Et_Tu_Google">Et Tu, Google?</a></h5>

<p>One of the most widespread criticisms of Google's announcement was the lack of transparency about the reasoning for shutting down the service. Ex-Microsoft Windows Chief Steve Sinofksy <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130316190832-2293107-data-is-not-always-a-substitute-for-strategy" target="_blank">criticizes the announcement</a> for citing usage statistics without putting them in context. Robert Evatt of the <em>Tulsa World</em> <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?articleid=20130319_52_E3_Google20338" target="_blank">ties the Reader discontinuation</a> to rumors that Google is planning to launch a newsstand service to compete with Apple.</p>

<h5><a name="Reader_Gets_The_Axe">Reader Gets The Axe</a></h5>

<p>Citing "a loyal following" but noting that "over the years usage has declined," Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html" target="_blank">announces the closure of Reader</a> in a post to its official blog. Early reactions are <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3006994/most-innovative-companies-2013/google-petitioned-fans-google-reader-reconsider-shutdown" target="_self">immediate and mostly negative</a>, although some high-profile figures such as RSS pioneer Dave Winer <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/yourOutlinerStory" target="_blank">write that the withdrawal</a> of the market leader will lead to new opportunities in what was a mostly static space.
