<p><strong>For those who missed it, "donglegate," as <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/03/richards-affair-and-misogyny-in-tech/" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em> dubbed it</a>, is the latest blowup after a display of sexism in the coding community.</strong> Although some people, including women in tech, took issue with the way Adria Richards handled the situation, <em>Wired</em>'s Alice Marwick puts it in context very bleakly:</p>

<blockquote><p>Regardless of the nuances of the incident, the fact remains that Richards faced a gargantuan backlash that included death threats, rape threats, a flood of racist and sexually violent speech, a DDOS attack on her employer--and a photoshopped picture of a naked, bound, decapitated woman. The use of mob justice to punish women who advocate feminist ideals is nothing new, but why does this happen so regularly when women criticize the tech industry? Just stating that the tech industry has a sexism problem--something that's supported by reams of scholarly evidence--riles up the trolls.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://jezebel.com/5991792/woman-in-tech-tweets-about-sexist-dudes-in-tech-dude-get-fired-internet-meltdown-ensues" target="_blank">Jezebel also chimed in</a>, pointing out the how these kinds of jokes are possible and seem normal because of how much of a dudefest tech is. It seems particularly egregious that these guys made these jokes right when the speaker was talking about bridging the gender gap in tech.</p>

<blockquote><p>Richards was distracted, mid-seminar, by a couple of tech bros sitting behind her making some shitty sexual puns about "dongles" and "forking." (She blogged about the <a href="http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/" target="_blank">full chronology of events here</a>.) Richards did not enjoy the jokes. She especially did not enjoy the disrespect shown to the speaker, who happened to be specifically, at that moment, addressing programs designed to make the tech community more welcoming to women. Meanwhile, in the audience--Richards's photos reveal a sea of men--a couple of dudes felt 100% comfortable cracking the kind of crude jokes that people generally reserve for their home turf. And that's because, to a lot of dudes, tech is a space owned by men.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://brucebyfield.com/about/" target="_blank">Bruce Byfield</a>, who has written extensively on all things free &amp; open source, gives <a href="http://www.datamation.com/open-source/state-of-sexism-in-foss-1.html" target="_blank">an overview of sexism in the FOSS community</a>.</strong> As a subset of the broader development community, FOSS has a lot of great things going for it because of its transparency and emphasis on collaboration. Unfortunately it still shares many of the same problems when it comes to gender. Byfield takes an informative look at initiatives that are trying to fix the gender imbalance, like the Geek Feminism Wiki, Ada Initiative, and Ubuntu Code of Conduct.</p>

<blockquote><p>Carla Schroder credits Ubuntu for its all-purpose <a href="https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0.1" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>, which she calls "a radical departure from the dominant 'freedom to be a jerk' ethos that prevailed before." As a result, Schroder adds, "Ubuntu has also attracted large numbers of contributors and users from more diverse walks of life than other distros.

<p>However, in the last two years, FOSS feminism has paid special attention to anti-harassment policies for conferences. Most of this work has been developed by the <a href="http://adainitiative.org/" target="_blank">Ada Initiative</a>, an offshoot of the Geek Feminism Wiki, which has developed <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/conference_anti-harassment/policy" target="_blank">templates</a> for policies that can be used either unmodified or as starting points for discussion.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://adainitiative.org/2012/10/how-stopping-conference-harassment-changes-opentech-communities-at-all-levels/" target="_blank">rationale</a> offered for this emphasis is that anti-harassment policies can be a starting point for changing other aspects of the community.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>All in all a thorough and well-reasoned piece worth a read (even if the pagination on datamation is ridiculously annoying).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ashedryden" target="_blank">Ashe Dryden</a>, a Drupal and Rails developer, did the software community a huge favor by starting to answer the question "How can I help tech be less sexist?"</strong> She gives <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference" target="_blank">concrete, applicable steps</a> that people can take to make conferences more diverse, like:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anonymize and remove gendered pronouns from abstracts/bios before handing the data over to your proposal review committee. Someone who is outside of your proposal reviewing committee should be assigned this task.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pretty simple, but makes a huge difference. Dryden's post is full of tidbits like that. It also includes a pretty thorough list of different marginalized populations, going far beyond gender diversity to include, for example, physical disability and economic status. But women in tech is still the focus of what Dryden is writing about.</p>

The headline of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2012/01/17/with-programs-like-codecademy-women-are-no-longer-accidentally-excluded-from-learning-technology/" target="_blank">this article</a> in Forbes elides individual (and organizational) responsibility by saying that women are "accidentally" excluded from tech.</strong> That said, it still makes a great point that tools like Codecademy are democratizing technology and thereby removing a lot of the traditional barriers to women, like it being hard to find mentorship in a boy's club.</p>

<p><strong>Dani Landers, a transgender woman game developer, gives an account of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1376061185/bloom-memories-one-of-a-kind-action-adventure-rpg/posts/424211" target="_blank">how her identity informs her game design decisions</a> in <em>Bloom</em>, a game currently vying for funding on Kickstarter.<br />
</strong><br />
<blockquote><p>It's no secret that the games industry, by and large, lacks diversity. In this case, that is gender diversity. This is actually a huge shame as it limits the stories and points of views different types of people bring to the collective table of gaming.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Landers contrasts the way she handles representation of female characters and motherhood with the way major video game studios do, which is pretty obvious in her artwork.</p>

<blockquote><p>The differences in the way I create concept art and models is pretty self-explanatory. Basically, notice how the female characters aren't half naked with giant breasts? Yea, this is a pretty easy one to be aware of...I'm kind of surprised this is even "different" to treat them with that level of respect.</p></blockquote>

<p>The influential gaming site Penny Arcade <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/video-games-showed-me-who-i-could-be-transgender-gamers-share-their-stories" target="_blank">picked up the story</a>, with a really interesting take on how gaming can be a safe haven for certain marginalized populations.</p>

<blockquote><p>Games themselves may offer a safe place for transgender, genderqueer, questioning, or other LGBT community individuals, but the gaming community has been less receptive. When Landers was promoting her game in one gaming community forum, users hijacked the thread and began posting "tranny porn," telling Landers she should find new work in the adult film industry.

<p>Articles and features on gaming sites that bring up gender representation of any kind, be it transgender or otherwise, is typically met with the 'Why is this important?' 'How is this relevant to video games?' style responses. It should be apparent by now that games can be far more than just entertainment to some individuals. To some, it's a necessary escape, or a safe haven where the question of "Who am i?" can be safely explored.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>So, a pretty prime example of women being reduced to sexual objects in the technology world is this article on Complex, "<a href="http://www.complex.com/tech/2013/03/the-40-hottest-women-in-tech/" target="_blank">The 40 Hottest Women in Tech</a>".</strong> At first glance the article is a weird mix of acknowledging sexism in tech followed by outright sexism from a publication covering tech. It begins:</p>

<blockquote><p>Technology has been a boy's club for most of its existence. Just another unfortunate repercussion of the patriarchy. But that's been slowly changing, and over the last decade we've seen a number of wonderful, intelligent, and cunning women make inspiring strides in the field of technology. Through web development, social media, space exploration, and video game design, we see the world of tech becoming a more equal playing field. Here are 40 women we admire doing work in the field of innovation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Followed by a slideshow of scantily clad women or typical "hot" women, including noting that one of them was a <em>Playboy</em> playmate. Commenters on the piece were justifiably outraged, writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>How can you open with "sure, tech hasn't been friendly to women for ages, but it's better now!" and then proceed to objectify the women who have fought through this bullshit? Do you not see that you're only perpetuating the toxic culture?</p></blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote><p>Funny you would mention patriarchy in your opening paragraph, then proceed to perpetuate it by subjecting all of the hardworking and talented women in this field to, effectively, a 'hot-or-not' list. Shameful.</p></blockquote>

<p>It turns out, though, that the author of this piece <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rjce0c" target="_blank">didn't want it turn out that way</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was assigned to write the 50 Hottest Women in Tech by Complex and it really bummed me out, because the idea of perpetrating the same old gender divisions in an area like tech - which has predominantly been a boy's club throughout history - seemed like kind of a messed up thing to do. It represents the most banal form of internet content that exists. But it's hard to say no to a paycheck.

<p>So what I tried to do was see if it was possible to make something called "The 50 Hottest Women in Tech" earnest and empowering and an actual good thing. I pretty much only included normal looking women, who were involved in something really crucial or exciting in the tech space. I made no allusions to their looks in the blurbs, and ended up with simply a long list of very exciting women.</p>

<p>Of course when the piece actually ran, I discovered that over half of the women I had included were replaced with people like Morgan Webb, complete with the usual lascivious dialogue. Sigh. It's hard to win when you're writing for Complex, but please know that I tried.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That explains why tech-entertainment celebs are mixed in with actual female technology innovators like Gina Trapani and Marissa Mayer. It's the mark of a bad publication that it would not only assign a piece like this in the first place but that it would so drastically alter it after the fact. Fortunately, people in technology fields weren't buying what Complex was selling, as evidenced by <a href="https://twitter.com/grossbart/status/320793127285846016" target="_blank"> this tweet</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lizquilty/status/319553425685762048" target="_blank"> this tweet</a>:</p>
