<p>You've built something you know has value. Now how do you get people to trade money for that value? Pricing your software product is one of the most difficult strategic processes any team goes through before taking something to market. There are dozens of factors that can influence what people will pay to become users--some of them within your control, many of them outside of it.</p>

<h3><a name="What_This_Story_Is_Tracking">What This Story Is Tracking</a></h3>

<p>We'll listen for stories about developers who have conducted pricing experiments with their own products and survived (or failed) to tell the tale. Advice from VCs and entrepreneurs on the psychology of pricing are also fair game for this track. Likewise, we'll pull in news and philosophy about alternative ways of supporting your product when end-user sales aren't a good option.</p>

<p><strong>There are four product qualities that dictate how you can convert new members, says Tom Tunguz.</strong> The right way to court new users depends on how quickly they will derive value from your product, how much of a learning curve it requires, and how much you intend to profit off each user. One important insight here is that your end user is not always the same as your buyer. In business software, Tunguz explains, your end users may simply be cheerleaders for your product who eventually convince whomever controls the purse strings to spring for your paid product. Tunguz calls these people "pre qualifiers." Here's a matrix of the different approaches, and how they correlate to the type of product you're selling. Via <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/your-startups-pricing-plan" target="_blank">Svbtle</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Freemium is a strategy for products whose value proposition is simply conveyed and whose value increases with time… The main difference between freemium and trial products is product complexity: trial products are more complex and need time for the user to gain a deeper understanding of the value… To pursue up front payment, you need an established brand with a clear value proposition and you sell the product to the end-user… For products lacking an established brand, but offering an immediate value proposition and charging a high average seat value, there is no better solution than the money back guarantee. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>One problem with freemium strategies is that they are easy to game.</strong> Knowing which type of freemium strategy to deploy is one step in the right direction, says VC Steven Dupree. Should you use "capacity-based freemium" or "feature-based freemium"? Mixing and matching different freemium models to different use cases is one approach, but certain combinations--namely using too many low-price, low conversion strategies--can sink companies. Here's how to do it right, via <a href="http://www.rglobal.com/flavors-freemium/" target="_blank">Richmond Global</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The French vanilla of the freemium world is the “use case freemium.” This overlooked and underused freemium model refers to products or services which are either free or paid based upon how the product is used.  The product functionality may be identical across use cases.  Examples include: free for non-commercial use (often with a label indicating “this is licensed for non-commercial use” so as to embarrass out-of-compliance companies); free for schools (perhaps a dot edu email is required); free for certain distribution channels; and free for non-profits.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Creating a marketplace for buyers and sellers can be a great way to profit without selling anything.</strong> But evaluating whether there is a need for your site of exchange is a sophisticated process: Some industries welcome new marketplaces, while others utterly ignore them. From VC Bill Gurley, who invested in eBay 15 years ago, comes the ten factors to consider when evaluating the viability of a digital marketplace, and why you should only attempt a marketplace that can achieve "clearinghouse" status. Via <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/11/13/all-markets-are-not-created-equal-10-factors-to-consider-when-evaluating-digital-marketplaces/" target="_blank">AboveTheCrowd</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A true marketplace needs natural pull on both the consumer and supplier side of the market. Aggregating suppliers is a necessary, but insufficient step on its own. You must also organically aggregate demand. With each step, it should get easier to acquire the incremental consumer AS WELL AS the incremental supplier. Highly liquid marketplaces naturally “tip” towards becoming a clearinghouse where neither the consumer nor the supplier would favor an alternative.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a summary of the 10 factors he says you should consider. Find full explanations in his post.</p>

<blockquote><p>New Experience vs. the Status Quo <br />
Economic Advantages vs. the Status Quo<br />
Opportunity for Technology to Add Value <br />
High Fragmentation <br />
Friction of Supplier Sign-Up<br />
Size of the Market Opportunity <br />
Expand the Market <br />
Frequency<br />
Payment Flow<br />
Network Effects</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Should you double your price?</strong> Some of the unconventional wisdom in this piece: double your price, and see if you can't make more money from less users, cutting your customer service costs in the process. Or switch to subscription pricing if your backend is in the cloud. Built a native app? Exploit in-app purchases, which are <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007021/open-company/what-every-ios-developer-should-know-about-app-purchases" target="_self">earning more and more as a proportion of total developer income</a>, at least on the iTunes Store. Via <a href="http://kevinhoctor.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-future-of-software-pricing.html" target="_blank">Kevin Hoctor</a>, the case for why developers should think carefully about the price of their software:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think everyone can agree that we won't survive long as indie developers if we can only charge one or two dollars for our apps. I don't even think $15 is enough unless you have an enormous audience. So what do we do? How do we compete with the "race to the bottom" inspired by the App Store? I don't have all the answers, but I do have my opinions and I'm willing to back them up with evidence through my business actions.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Developers don't always have a common-sense understanding of "value" as the user sees it.</strong> This blog post by Lexi Friedman in Macworld is one example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Of the top 20 best-selling iPhone apps, 15 of them cost $1; the priciest one costs $7. The average price of the top 100 paid apps in the App Store is less than $2. I’m neither an economist nor a psychologist, but it strikes me that too many iOS device owners fail to act in their own best interests—both in the immediate near term and in the long term—when they scoff at the thought of spending money in the App Store. Here’s how customers who spend lavishly on iOS hardware punish themselves by skimping on apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Friedman continues by saying that developers have got themselves in this fix by creating a vicious cycle of low-priced apps.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, if developers are pricing their apps at $1 (even though some would argue that they shouldn’t), then we needn’t feel guilty for buying them. But, to a certain extent, it’s become a catch-22: Developers are pricing their apps too cheaply, because that’s what they think people will actually pay. And so long as they’re right, we as cheap customers are having a negative impact on a lot of both real and potential businesses.</p></blockquote>

<p>Friedman's argument is that apps cost money--usually the better the app, the more it costs to develop. But developers need to consider that their end user may not be the best person to pay for the service, even if it's excellent, and even if they love it. If your user won't tolerate a higher price, then you need to find alternative ways to monetize him or her, which may include using their aggregate data to collect insights you sell to a third party, or exploiting advertising or partnerships. Friedman seems to think that an underlying problem is that consumers don't think rationally about the value of an app, versus other small purchases.</p>

[quote]I’m not a fan of the “cup of coffee” comparison so often bandied about in conversations about spending money on apps—both because I dislike the comparison and coffee itself. I’ll use my own Diet Soda Analogy instead: I often skip the diet soda at a restaurant, because water’s fine, and I’m happy to save a couple bucks on chemical-laden beverages, regardless of how delicious they may be. But where the $2.50 soda might have brought me mere minutes of enjoyment, a $5 game could bring me hours of fun and a $10 app could boost my productivity in all sorts of ways. I’ll also spend $9 per month on Netflix for the promise of a few hours of entertainment each month, and many will spend $40 to $60 for a console video game. It’s worth spending money on things that can improve your life—even if they don’t come shipped to your home in a cardboard box.[/url]

<p>But developers can't simply argue users into seeing the value and coughing up money. The problem is trust--not that people are too dumb to see what software is worth. In other words, most users don't trust they'll actually get long-term value out of this thing, because they may not be aware of the person who built it, or their motivations. Will it work? Will it do what I want? Will it still be supported in a few months? Many users might be surprised to learn that so many small businesses--the kind they support IRL in their own communities--make their living off apps, or that these indie developer shops might have better intentions than the average corporate software company.</p>
