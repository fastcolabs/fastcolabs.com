<p>I've been a foreigner a lot. Japan was home for three years, France for six months in college. The rush of trying to stay on top of a fast-moving cultural wave is addictive. Channeling a foreign frequency-- the alternative rhythms of a place that's not your own-- I've found transformational. You feel another culture changing you, your personality evolving, when you become a code-switcher. You develop new sets of symbols, new associations and priorities, new ways of seeing and expressing your self.</p>

<p>So I was fascinated to read about a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/06/12/1304435110" target="_blank">new study</a>, co-authored by Chinese-American Shu Zhang, a Columbia Business School student, and social psychologist Michael Morris, also at Columbia, which showed how a bilingual person's brain gets hijacked by symbols, tripping up her two linguistic selves and slowing her down. Native Chinese speakers are 11% less fluent in English (in words per minute) when talking to a Chinese-American face named Michael Lee than to a Caucasian one with the same name, and produce 16% more words describing American symbols in English (White House, Marilyn Monroe, Superman) than Chinese ones (Great Wall, dragons, yin-yang). When looking at China-evocative pictures, they are also 85% more likely to use a literal translation of the Chinese word for an object rather than the English.</p>

<p>Cultural symbols here are like <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672666/the-worlds-most-famous-logos-organized-by-visual-theme#1" target="_self">corporate logos</a>: Picture Apple's icon, the McDonald's arches, Nike's swoosh, Lacoste's alligator, Playboy's bunny, the Twitter bird, Starbucks' lady, MTV's letters or the red Solo cup you drank all that booze from in college. Doesn't each trigger a flood of personal memories? All those papers you wrote at Starbucks; the preppy frat guys you knew (or were) in popped-collar polo shirts; the shame you still feel about those magazines you took from dad's underwear drawer in fifth grade... The brands that invented the logos want them to sell more products. But, this study suggests, depending on the audience, they may be distracting.</p>

<p>The discovery that cultural cues affect language fluency so dramatically has significance beyond second-language speakers. We are all producers and consumers of speech, writing and images. We're all trying to tell succinct stories, whether to convey news, to entertain, to educate, or sell something-- and we often don't think enough about the associations that the images we use might have. How many different places our words and images might transport our audiences, depending on where they're coming from.</p>

<p>Japanese images are time-portals for me now. When I walk through the East Village past red-paper lanterns, I remember the outdoor onsen volcanic baths where my Japanese friends used to take us-- a regular Japanese tourist destination, where families bathe in the river at night, by lantern light. The Ippudo ramen near NYU sends me back to the Momotaro-dori, or "Peach-Boy Street", the main avenue in my old prefecture's capital city, Okayama, where we used to go for noodles. Peach-Boy's image itself is evocative: whenever I see pictures of him in sushi restaurants, walking with his dog, bird, and monkey, my mind is flooded with memories of meeting Okayama friends around the Mototaro statue in front of the eki-- I mean, train station.</p>

<p>But to you, assuming you're not Japanese and haven't lived there, Momotaro's image is just a naked Asian boy. What the new study suggests is that that blip of recognition-- that jarring culture-clash of a symbol out of context-- may basically clutter my communication channel with noise. These visual associative cues can communicate rich webs of content fast, but they can also interrupt fluency if they trigger the wrong chain.</p>

<p>"Understanding how these subtle cultural cues affect language fluency could help employers design better job interviews," <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/trying-to-learn-a-foreign-langua.html" target="_blank">ScienceNOW reporter Emily Underwood explains</a>. "For example, taking a Japanese job candidate out for sushi, although a well-meaning gesture, might not be the best way to help them shine." The same lesson applies to media: displaying Japanese imagery, for example, to a Japanese viewer or reader of English will likely create unanticipated hurdles to comprehension. Picking the right chain of associations, on the other hand, in the pictures we use, might promote meaning.</p>

<p>Language-teachers and -learners have long known that immersion is the best and most efficient way to learn a foreign language. The <a href="http://rassias.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Rassias Foundation</a> at Dartmouth, where I learned my first words of Japanese in a two-week bootcamp where English was outlawed, and the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/ls" target="_blank">Middlebury Language Schools</a> (motto: "No English Spoken Here") have earned their reputations on this principle. The fact that English in Japan does not tend to be taught this way, but rather with lessons on grammar and vocabulary taught in Japanese, supplemented by visits by native-English-speaking assistant teachers, may be why <a href="http://www.ef.com/ca/about-ef/press/release/news_21_02_2013_japan_english/" target="_blank">Japan ranks only 22nd of 54 countries in English proficiency, according to Education First</a>.</p>

<p>Immersion has the obvious advantage of heavy exposure to the sounds of a language, and forced engagement. But the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that there's something deeper-- and not strictly linguistic-- about immersion abroad which facilitates fluency in a new language.</p>

<p>Speaking a foreign language is more social than linguistic; more like swimming or riding a bike than memorizing multiplication tables. Motivation and expressivity are key: having something you want to say, and a person you want to tell. You learn a language fast when you're dating a foreigner, or when you're one of two western men in a rice-paddy village, and want to make new friends. What you're doing in those situations is marinating in associations-- soaking in experience.</p>

<p>You talk in new ways, not just new words, when you live immersed. You make friends differently, date differently, work differently. I'd never bowed to my boss before I met the mayor of Yakage. I'd never been called "sensei" or bowed to every morning, until I met my elementary-school students. I'll always remember my Japanese friend telling me to pay more attention to the beer in my dinner companions' glasses, so I could refill them (no Japanese person would refill her own glass, considering it rude), and since then I've been sensitive to others' bi-ru when I'm in Japan, but not in New York. The same beer glass in Osaka or New York is a different beer glass. Or as Basho put it: Even in Kyoto/ when I hear the cuckoo sing/ I long for Kyoto.</p>

<p>Images, whether in pictures or in words,  are potent evokers of meaning. Webs of associations dependent on culture, they can animate or distract from our message-- a crucial lesson for us culture-makers to keep in mind.</p>
