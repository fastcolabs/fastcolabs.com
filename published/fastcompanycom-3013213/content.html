<p>I've been a foreigner a lot. Japan was home for three years, France for six months in college. The rush of trying to stay on top of a fast-moving cultural wave is addictive. Channeling a foreign frequency-- the alternative rhythms of a place that's not your own-- I've found transformational. You feel another culture changing you, your personality evolving, when you become a code-switcher. You develop new sets of symbols, new associations and priorities, new ways of seeing and expressing your self.</p>

<p>So I was fascinated to read about a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/06/12/1304435110" target="_blank">new study</a>, co-authored by Chinese-American Shu Zhang, a Columbia Business School student, and social psychologist Michael Morris, also at Columbia, which showed how a bilingual person's brain gets hijacked by symbols, tripping up her two linguistic selves and slowing her down. Native Chinese speakers are 11% less fluent in English (in words per minute) when talking to a Chinese-American face named Michael Lee than to a Caucasian one with the same name, and produce 16% more words describing American symbols in English (White House, Marilyn Monroe, Superman) than Chinese ones (Great Wall, dragons, yin-yang). When looking at China-evocative pictures, they are also 85% more likely to use a literal translation of the Chinese word for an object rather than the English.</p>

<p>Cultural symbols here are like <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672666/the-worlds-most-famous-logos-organized-by-visual-theme#1" target="_self">corporate logos</a>: Picture Apple's icon, the McDonald's arches, Nike's swoosh, Lacoste's alligator, Playboy's bunny, the Twitter bird, Starbucks' lady, MTV's letters or the red Solo cup you drank all that booze from in college. Doesn't each trigger a flood of personal memories? All those papers you wrote at Starbucks; the preppy frat guys you knew (or were) in popped-collar polo shirts; the shame you still feel about those magazines you took from dad's underwear drawer in fifth grade... The brands that invented the logos want them to sell more products. But, this study suggests, depending on the audience, they may be distracting.</p>

<p>The discovery that cultural cues affect language fluency so dramatically has significance beyond second-language speakers. We are all producers and consumers of speech, writing and images. We're all trying to tell succinct stories, whether to convey news, to entertain, to educate, or sell something-- and we often don't think enough about the associations that the images we use might have. How many different places our words and images might transport our audiences, depending on where they're coming from.</p>

<p>Japanese images are time-portals for me now. When I walk through the East Village past red-paper lanterns, I remember the outdoor onsen volcanic baths where my Japanese friends used to take us-- a regular Japanese tourist destination, where families bathe in the river at night, by lantern light. The Ippudo ramen near NYU sends me back to the Momotaro-dori, or "Peach-Boy Street", the main avenue in my old prefecture's capital city, Okayama, where we used to go for noodles. Peach-Boy's image itself is evocative: whenever I see pictures of him in sushi restaurants, walking with his dog, bird, and monkey, my mind is flooded with memories of meeting Okayama friends around the Mototaro statue in front of the eki-- I mean, train station.</p>

<p>But to you, assuming you're not Japanese and haven't lived there, Momotaro's image is just a naked Asian boy. What the new study suggests is that that blip of recognition-- that jarring culture-clash of a symbol out of context-- may basically clutter my communication channel with noise. These visual associative cues can communicate rich webs of content fast, but they can also interrupt fluency if they trigger the wrong chain.</p>

<p>"Understanding how these subtle cultural cues affect language fluency could help employers design better job interviews," <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/trying-to-learn-a-foreign-langua.html" target="_blank">ScienceNOW reporter Emily Underwood explains</a>. "For example, taking a Japanese job candidate out for sushi, although a well-meaning gesture, might not be the best way to help them shine." The same lesson applies to media: displaying Japanese imagery, for example, to a Japanese viewer or reader of English will likely create unanticipated hurdles to comprehension. Picking the right chain of associations, on the other hand, in the pictures we use, might promote meaning.</p>

<p>Language-teachers and -learners have long known that immersion is the best and most efficient way to learn a foreign language. The <a href="http://rassias.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Rassias Foundation</a> at Dartmouth, where I learned my first words of Japanese in a two-week bootcamp where English was outlawed, and the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/ls" target="_blank">Middlebury Language Schools</a> (motto: "No English Spoken Here") have earned their reputations on this principle. The fact that English in Japan does not tend to be taught this way, but rather with lessons on grammar and vocabulary taught in Japanese, supplemented by visits by native-English-speaking assistant teachers, may be why <a href="http://www.ef.com/ca/about-ef/press/release/news_21_02_2013_japan_english/" target="_blank">Japan ranks only 22nd of 54 countries in English proficiency, according to Education First</a>.</p>

<p>Immersion has the obvious advantage of heavy exposure to the sounds of a language, and forced engagement. But the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that there's something deeper-- and not strictly linguistic-- about immersion abroad which facilitates fluency in a new language.</p>

<p>Speaking a foreign language is more social than linguistic; more like swimming or riding a bike than memorizing multiplication tables. Motivation and expressivity are key: having something you want to say, and a person you want to tell. You learn a language fast when you're dating a foreigner, or when you're one of two western men in a rice-paddy village, and want to make new friends. What you're doing in those situations is marinating in associations-- soaking in experience.</p>

<p>You talk in new ways, not just new words, when you live immersed. You make friends differently, date differently, work differently. I'd never bowed to my boss before I met the mayor of Yakage. I'd never been called "sensei" or bowed to every morning, until I met my elementary-school students. I'll always remember my Japanese friend telling me to pay more attention to the beer in my dinner companions' glasses, so I could refill them (no Japanese person would refill her own glass, considering it rude), and since then I've been sensitive to others' bi-ru when I'm in Japan, but not in New York. The same beer glass in Osaka or New York is a different beer glass. Or as Basho put it: Even in Kyoto/ when I hear the cuckoo sing/ I long for Kyoto.</p>

<p>Images, whether in pictures or in words,  are potent evokers of meaning. Webs of associations dependent on culture, they can animate or distract from our message-- a crucial lesson for us culture-makers to keep in mind.</p>

<p><span class="subhead">June 19, 2013</span></p>

<p>Doctors say brain-zapping-- transcranial Direct Brain Stimulation (tDBS) applied to the scalp, noninvasively--may work to treat <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/promising-depression-therapy/" target="_blank">depression</a>, <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/05/trouble-with-math-maybe-you-shou.html?ref=hp" target="_blank">math trouble</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452211003666" target="_blank">language fluency</a>; and, in healthy people, may enhance focus, a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328501.600-zap-your-brain-into-the-zone-fast-track-to-pure-focus.html" target="_blank">sniper's aim</a>, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=amping-up-brain-function" target="_blank">drone-piloting</a>, or even a <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/scienceshot-beer-goggles-for-you.html?ref=hp" target="_blank">dried-up libido</a>. But not even the white coats know yet how the technology works--what exactly it does to the brain. Worse, we have no clue what side effects may come later. Hope is warranted, but so is caution, and a critical mind. Don't trade your brain for a boner, as so many technophilic journalists do, at your first glimpse of neuro-pornography.</p>

<p>Be skeptical: skeptical of the guy who wants to sell you his miracle invention, and of the doctors who say they'll fix your sadness with a zap or a pill. More noteworthy than any buzzy new gadget or drug is how little anyone yet understands the map between that electrified hunk of wet tissue in your skull and the feelings that are you and me.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH), one of the biggest funders of brain research, called the psychiatric community out on this last month: Saying "Patients deserve better," its <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-scientific-backlash-against-the-dsm.html" target="_blank">director Tom Insell announced that the institute would be abandoning the DSM-5</a>--the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition--because its categorization scheme has so poorly explained the neural underpinnings of the mind, healthy and ill.</p>

<p>Gadgets are great, but understanding is better: We should be demanding that knowledge from our scientists and neuro-tech pioneers--not cheap cheat-codes for the brain.</p>

<hr />

<p>There's nothing new about brain-stimulating the mentally-ill: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy" target="_blank">electroconvulsive</a> therapy (ECT), invented in 1932 by Italian neuropsychiatrists, and made notorious by the novels <em>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</em> and <em>A Clockword Orange</em> in 1962, is still the gold-standard treatment for nonremittant depression and mania, more than eighty years after its invention. More effective than any antidepressant pill, than exercise or talk therapy, electrically-induced seizures often bring suicidal or catatonically depressed patients back. Yet no one knows how, almost a century after the procedure was invented. Nor can any shrink explain or predict electroshock's rare but catastrophic side effects, like memory loss and mania. Ernest Hemingway shot himself after undergoing ECT at Mayo Clinic in 1961. Before his suicide, he told his biographer "Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory? <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/4400883" target="_blank">It was a brilliant cure, but we lost the patient.</a>"</p>

<p>There's also nothing new about cognitive enhancement--the dream of neural holy grails like Ritalin--or commercial hucksters out to part gullible healthy folks from their money.</p>

<p>The CEO of MIND Alive Inc. is neither a doctor nor a psychologist. Dave Siever has no degree beyond a B.A. in <a href="http://www.mindalive.com/1_2.htm" target="_blank">telecommunications</a> from the North Alberta Institute of Technology. He  got his start making <a href="http://www.mindalive.com/2_0/Rediscovery.htm" target="_blank">"audio-visual entrainment" (AVE) devices</a> for dentists, to help treat patients with jaw stiffness, or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) (a condition related to psychological stress), and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ny7M8_SlSw" target="_blank">DAVID</a> devices to help performing arts students overcome stage fright. But the innovation that got the attention of <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/06/12/transcranial-direct-current-stimulation-tdcs-technology/" target="_blank"><em>Canada's National Post</em></a> last week is his latest product: a  brain-zapping device he says improves memory, concentration, relaxation and mood, and can be used to treat mental disorders from depression to ADHD.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mindalive.com/Studies_Performed_with_the_DAVID_Devices.pdf" target="_blank">list</a> on Siever's website of 18 publications "proving" the efficacy of the brain-stimulating devices produced and sold by his company includes five that are unpublished, presumably because their data lack the statistical sturdiness to withstand peer review. The entrepreneur himself is a co-author of four of the papers. The journals that have vouched for his gadget include one on hypnosis and one called <em>The Journal of Neurotherapy</em>, a young journal for neurofeedback enthusiasts, created in 2002, which does not yet have an impact factor (the usual measure of a scientific journal's influence and merit in the field), but <a href="http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16769&amp;amp;tip=sid" target="_blank">has an <em>h-index</em> of only 11</a>--meaning only eleven papers published in the journal have been cited more than 11 times. By comparison, the h-index of the journal Nature Neuroscience is 241, and that of Neuron is 288. The top-tier scientific journals Science and Nature have h-indices of 711 and 731, respectively: 731, versus eleven. So, the scientific consensus backing Siever's bold salesman's claims is, well, pretty thin.</p>

<p>You wouldn't imagine so, though, from the shininess of the stuff he says. "tDCS produces immediate and lasting sharpness and reasoning of mind," Siever declared in the International Society of Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) Newsletter, Spring 2013. In a section of his article oddly titled "Depression, Mood, and Brainwave," the professorial non-professor tells his readers that "Right-brain strokes spawn cheerful survivors while left-brain strokes leave the survivor with depression... This supports the 'happy-left' and 'depressed-right' scenario." Run this "happy-left-brain, depressed-right" theory by any PhD or MD, and you will get laughter. Nobody familiar with the hazy current state of knowledge on emotion in the brain would presume to say something so confident, simple and bold. Doctors and scientists with brain-pictures look just as dumb as Siever when they make brash claims about where emotions live in cortex, for the simple reason that this is not known.</p>

<p>Skeptical psychiatrists and cognitive neuroscientists have cautioned against patients using commercially available tDCS devices like these (Sold online by <a href="http://www.neuroconn.de/" target="_blank">Neuro Conn</a> (Germany; U.S. $10,500); <a href="http://www.magstim.com/tdcs/tdcs-hdckit" target="_blank">HDCKit, distributed by Magstim</a> (Italy, just under $10,000); <a href="http://www.smartstim.com/" target="_blank">StartStim</a> (Spain, around $10,000); <a href="http://soterixmedical.com/tdcs.php" target="_blank">1X1 tDCS by Soterix</a> (USA, $4,500); and the <a href="http://www.mindalive.com/Products_OASIS_Pro.htm" target="_blank">Oasis Pro by MIND Alive</a>, for around $450). They point out that tDCS makers don't have medical licenses, and users may not know where to put the electrodes or how much current to apply. Nevertheless, sound medical evidence from the University of Sao Paulo, <a href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1568955" target="_blank">published in JAMA-Psychiatry</a> last February, showed brain-stimulation to be as effective as the antidepressant drug Zoloft in treating depression-- and less risky than alternatives transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and ECT, which can trigger seizures. In reporting their impressive results with restraint, the Brazilian doctors joined a chorus of responsible scientists.</p>

<p>"We strongly caution you not to try this at home," one Oxford cognitive neuroscientist <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/05/trouble-with-math-maybe-you-shou.html?ref=hp" target="_blank">told <em>Science NOW</em></a> in a report on her own finding that tDCS can promote math-learning ability. "No matter how tempted you may be to slap a battery on your kid's head."</p>

<p>Still, as Slate's Will Oremus points out in <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982213004867" target="_blank">"Spark of Genius"</a>, the smartest post I've read yet on the slippery slope of brain-enhancement, we'd be foolish to reject the prospect offhand. As Duke bioethicist and philosophy professor <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-scientific-backlash-against-the-dsm.html" target="_blank">Allen Buchanan told <em>The Atlantic</em>'s Ross Andersen</a>, quoted by Oremus:</p>

<p>“The list of design flaws in human beings is pretty long, as it is in other organisms, and so to think that somehow we're at the summit of perfection and that we're stable is to have the wrong idea of human nature. The misleading assumption is that if we don't interfere, we're going to continue the way we are, and of course that goes completely contrary to everything we know about evolution. In fact it might turn out that the only way to prevent us from going extinct, or to prevent some great worsening of our condition, is to enhance some of our capacities.”</p>

<p>So humans are going to evolve-- we've got no choice. Technology will change us. If the futurists from last week's <a href="http://gf2045.com/" target="_blank">"Singularity Conference" <em>Global Future 2045</em></a> have their way, we'll soon be <a href="http://instagram.com/p/alMj-BM84w/#" target="_blank">living forever</a>, as computerized consciousnesses embodied in synthetic avatars like Japanese roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro's self-copy <a href="http://gf2045.com/speakers/#p135" target="_blank">Geminoid</a>. We've got no choice but to face this new world bravely.</p>

<p>The key thing is to be a smart consumer: brain, not boner. Whether dealing with doctors or sellers of brain-zapping machines, let's demand evidence to go with the fancy tools.</p>
