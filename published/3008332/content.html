<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobrowsing" target="_blank">Co-browsing</a> is an inevitable evolution of the way we surf the web. That's why we've been watching apps like <a href="https://getjuntoo.com" target="_blank">Juntoo</a> with great anticipation--it's an iPad app that allows two people to co-view PDFs, websites, documents, and images. But sometimes you just need something light and web-based to get your point across.</p>

<p>That's the concept behind the <a href="http://screencast.pensieve.net" target="_blank">Pensieve screencast</a>, a simple utility that lets you draw on the screen with your Wacom tablet (or cursor), capture the screencast, and send it as a link or embed. This isn't exactly co-browsing, but it's a much faster form of asynchronous demonstration that fits somewhere between a WebEx and and an email attachment (or some other delayed message).</p>

<p>The point here isn't that you can solve all your collaborative challenges just by capturing your screen, but rather to demonstrate that there is a lot of territory between <em>real time</em> and everything else, with room for an array of bespoke tools for different jobs.</p>
