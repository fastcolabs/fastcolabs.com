<p>With all the information access we give our smartphones, OS security exploits rightly get immediate attention (and nearly-immediate patching). But there’s a secondary OS running behind iOS, Android and the rest, used exclusively to interpret radio signals to cell towers--whose <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone" target="_blank">90s-era code has such minimal exploit mitigation</a> that it’s a wonder it hasn’t been used for large-scale hacks or pranks.</p>

<p>For starters, this OS operates in real-time--it’s called a real-time OS, or RTOS--and sits in firmware running on the baseband processor (which is the master to the application processor running the front-end OS). The software here is all proprietary, its source code locked, preventing peer review. As <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone" target="_blank">OSNews’ Thom Holwerda points out</a>, this is by design, since the baseband processor/radio combo were designed in the 80s, coded in the 90s, and built to inherently trust incoming data from a base station like a cell tower. And since baseband controls radio, you can hack it over the air--no local connection to the device is required.</p>

<p>So what’s standing between you and widespread hacking? Nothing but ignorance. Coded 20 years ago and fully proprietary, the antiquity and lack of awareness of around RTOSes are their saving grace; in fact, the OS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system" target="_blank">only exists on Wikipedia as a single note</a> referencing Holwerda’s article. On the other hand, most phone providers buy off-the-shelf baseband implementation, meaning that if you crack one, you crack them all.</p>

<p>“Baseband hacking” became a real thing to fear as far back as 2008 when the jailbreak pioneering iPhone Dev Team <a href="http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/25C3_presentation_%22Hacking_the_iPhone%22" target="_blank">spoke about iPhone baseboard hacking possibilities</a> at 25C3 in Berlin. University of Luxembourg Security Researcher Ralf Philipp Weinmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQqv0v14KKY" target="_blank">discussed it at DeepSec2010</a> and it finally <a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/01/18/baseband_hacking_a_new_frontier_for_smartphone_break_ins" target="_blank">buzzed around the mediasphere</a> in early-to-mid 2011 after Weinmann’s Black Hat presentation.</p>

<p>Despite Weinmann’s ability to hack one of these with an airborne 73-byte message to get a remote code execution, the execution of such a hack is still difficult for the average hacker--so much that a <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/apple-iphone-samsung-galaxy-s4-hacked%2Cnews-17860.html" target="_blank">$100,000 prize was left on the table at last weekend’s Pwn2Own competition in Tokyo</a> after hackers failed to hack any phone’s baseband processor.</p>
