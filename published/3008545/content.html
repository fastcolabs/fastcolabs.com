<p><strong>What the profit margin means for iPhone and iPad sales.</strong>The headline news was that while profits and revenue increased to $9.5 billion and $43.6 billion respectively over the same quarter last year, profit margins fell for the first time since 2008. Gross profit margins fell from 47.4% to 37.5% of revenue, compared with the same quarter last year while net profit margin also fell from 26.68 to 21.79%.</p>

<p>Gross profit margin is the ratio between sales and the cost of making the goods sold, while net profit margin includes all costs, including taxes. These margins are notable since Apple has by far the highest profit margins in the business. Samsung's profit margin, in contrast, was 17.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>

<p>Apple's margin drop seems to be mainly due to the mix of products the company sold in Q1, 2013 and the gross profit margin on each. Business Insider puts the decline down to the following trend:</p>

<blockquote><p>A shift in product mix toward lower-margin iPads and lower-margin cheaper iPhones. Apple slashed the price of the iPhone 4 to try to sell more units in China. Also, thanks to the slowdown in sales of the iPhone, a greater percentage of Apple's revenue now.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Is The iPhone Pulling Its Weight? </strong>A set of charts published by Bare Figures show that the iPhone accounted for a massive 52.65% of Apple's revenue in Q2, 2013. Its next biggest product the iPad brings in a mere 20.06%. The iPhone became Apple's biggest product in terms of revenue in 2009 and the percentage of revenue for which it accounts has been climbing ever since. But there are a few problems with that picture.</p>

<p>Firstly, while Apple is selling more iPhones than ever (37.4 million in Q2, 2013), iPhone sales grew only 7% last quarter, well below the estimated 30% growth rate for the smartphone industry as a whole. In addition, consumers are buying a lot more older models than they did with previous releases. A study published by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that 53 percent of all iPhones sold worldwide are iPhone 5. The rest were iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a very different sales pattern than what we saw in the second quarter of the iPhone 4S’s availability. When that device was the latest model, it accounted for 73 percent of all iPhone sales in April 2012, a significantly larger share than the iPhone.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The iPhone 5 brings has a much higher profit margin than older models so the fact that people are buying fewer of the latest iPhone model is hitting the company's overall profit margins. Last year GadgetMasters looked at the cost of making an iPhone 5.</p>

<blockquote><p>The unlocked version of the iPhone 5 costs around $649 for 16GB, so the difference between manufacturing cost of $207 and $649 retail price is $442. That translates into a profit margin of around 68% per iPhone.</p></blockquote>

<p>That margin is still astonishingly high in comparison to Apple's rivals. Bernstein Research analyst Mark Newman estimates that Samsung’s gross profit margin for the Galaxy S4 will be 46%.</p>

<p>Apple's other iPhone problem is that the biggest new smartphone markets will be in emerging countries like India and China but at the current pricing its devices are just too expensive for those markets. The company faces the unpalatable choice of slashing prices or losing market share. In China, Apple cut the price of its older iPhone 4 but revenues still only grew by just eight per cent on a year-over-year basis, according to the earnings release.</p>

<p>Tim Worstall at Forbes weighs in with the following analysis.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can get a Chinese Android cheapo for $100 or less these days. Much of the world does not operate handset subsidies as is common in the US and Europe. You want a piece of hardware then you pay for it, all of it, on day one. Such a pricing system is obvious.[quote]

<p>So fewer people in the U.S. and Europe are buying the latest versions of the iPhone and iPad and even older models may still be too expensive for the rest of the world unless Apple slashes prices, and therefore margins, considerably.</p>

<p>One way out of this bind is to introduce new products which will take over from the iPhone as Apple's cash cows. The company said in the earnings call that it would introduce entirely new categories of product starting this Fall.</p>

<p>What About Software Services?</p>

<p>Appe's management said during the earnings call that the company plans to new “product categories of hardware, software and services.” The services part may be crucial. One of the tricks Apple uses to boost gross profit margins is extra storage. Zdnet explains.</p>

[quote]Once again, Apple -- like Google and Amazon -- is charging a premium price for extra storage. If you want to upgrade from the 16GB base model to the 32GB iPhone 5, this will cost you an extra $100, but the additional flash storage only costs Apple $10.</p></blockquote>

<p>Media services drive a need for more storage. Darcy Travlos at Forbes notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Second, management, for the first time, brought “iTunes and software” to the forefront. They emphasized that the combined category accounted for more than $4B in sales in the quarter (slightly less than 10% of overall revenues), or a $16B annual run rate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another hint that new services may be a big part of Apple's new strategy was the emphasis which the company's management placed on metrics other than units and market share.</p>

<blockquote><p>Throughout the call, they rattled off supporting statistics: #1 in sixth year in a row for customer satisfaction via JD Powers, 97% loyalty rate, and 82% of North American web traffic accessed via an iOS device.</p></blockquote>

<p>ICloud’s user base also jumped 20% from 250 million last quarter to 300 million users. Over at ComputerWorld, Jonny Evans concludes the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Apple has been making significant investments in putting together the infrastructure it will require to deliver a series of unique services designed to differentiate its devices from the competition. The future of Apple depends on its successful evolution from being a device-centric firm into a services and solutions provider.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are services the way forward for Apple? Are iPhone margins on a permanent downward slide? Will a new product replace the iPhone as Apple's breadwinner? We will be tracking this story as it develops.</p>

<h2><a name="Previous_Updates">Previous Updates</a></h2>

<p><strong>In the realm of fanboyism, the "–hater" suffix is common.</strong> You have Microsoft-haters, Samsung-haters, Google-haters, and of course, Apple-haters. Until recently, the –hater suffix was nothing but harmless fanboyism. Recently, however, it seems that Apple-hating has become a full-time job for financial professionals, some of who stand to make millions every time someone disparages the company.</p>

<p>The health of a company as sophisticated as Apple—which encompasses an entire ecosystem—is a difficult thing to measure. It's even more difficult when that company is Apple: A brand replete with goodwill and cash. So people fall back on a reductive measure: Stock price.</p>

<p>Apple's stock has declined from $705 to the low $390s in just over seven months—that's 40%. This decline has most people in the media screaming, <em>"Apple is dead! Abandon ship while you can!"</em> And why not? It's good for page-view, and who doesn't enjoy a little schadenfreude?</p>

<p>But there are hidden actors at work here, namely money managers and media companies, who like to promote every instance of Apple-doubting in the media. Here's just one example of the media playing up Apple's death without getting their facts right, as <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/04/spot-the-error/" target="_blank">John Moltz points out on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spot the error

<p>Erik Sherman writing for CBS about the “Apple meltdown” (via Sat Tara Khalsa):</p>

<p>"Anonymous supply chain sources say that <strong>iPad mini unit sales</strong> could drop 20 percent to 30 percent this quarter, compared with <strong>the same period last year</strong>."</p>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) Apple’s apparently doing so badly that returns of the iPad mini will be so high next quarter that they’ll drive sales into negative numbers. Which is the only way they could sell fewer than zero. That pretty much sums up the current state of reporting on Apple right there, doesn’t it?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Shoddy reporting is one thing, but here's a more serious example. This one <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/22/apple-cook-whisper-campaign/?utm_source=loopinsight.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed" target="_blank">comes from Philip Elmer-DeWitt at Fortune</a>. He's talking about the rumors in recent days that—wait for it—Tim Cook is being handed his hat by Apple. Here's what Elmer-DeWitt says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The last time we wrote about Doug Kass -- a small hedge fund manager with a large presence on CNBC -- it was to document a nifty piece of stock manipulation played out on his Twitter feed in February, the day before Apple's annual shareholder meeting.

<p>Apple's (AAPL) share price was down and Kass was long the stock. He tweeted a rumor that the company was about to announce a split, the stock went up, he sold his shares at a profit, he tweeted that the rumor was baseless and then spent the rest of the day hurling insults at his critics.</p>

<p>Well, Kass is at it again. On Sunday, citing the same "Gnome" that was the source for his stock split story, he tweeted: @DougKass: From my Gnome, high above the Alps - "Is Apple's Tim Cook... Cooked?</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Many assume people only make money on a stock if that stock goes up and they sell. But in reality, people can make millions shorting a stock as valuable as Apple's. So, as Elmer-DeWitt points out, professional Apple-haters like Kass have a lot to gain. And who else is in that group? Many, Elmer-DeWitt finds:</p>

<blockquote><p><ul>
  <li><span>We've got the tweet from Doug Kass, whose main Apple-related claim to fame was to publish his "Bear Case for Apple" the day before the stock began a nosedive that lopped nearly $300 billion off the market cap of the world's most valuable company.</span></li>
  <li><span>We've got "The impossible task of fixing Apple" by Rob Enderle, a consultant for Dell (DELL), Microsoft (MSFT), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and others, who has made a career of bad-mouthing Apple in print and on TV. (For background on Enderle, you can start with John Gruber's 2003 Putting the 'anal' in 'analyst'.)</span></li>
  <li><span>We've got "Sunday's Is Apple Looking For A Replacement For CEO Cook?" in Forbes.com, the online arm of a once-respected business publication whose experiment in what it calls "incentive-based, entrepreneurial journalism" has led to what Macworld calls "a relentless clown show of anti-Apple contributors."</span></li>
</ul></p></blockquote>

<p>Usually financial news of a company and a company's stock price should be of little concern to developers. But when there is so much disinformation (but let's call them "rumors" to be nice) spreading about a company's impeding demise—a company that's <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-paid-developers-1-billion-in-a-month-2013-2" target="_blank">paid $1 billion dollars to developers</a> in <em>just one month</em>—developers need to start getting angry, because this effects their livelihoods.</p>

<p>After all, if consumers believe a healthy company is one step from death's door, why would they buy its products and, ultimately, your apps?</p>

<p><strong>Wall Street turns on Apple.</strong> The <em>New York Times</em> documents how Wall Street has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/technology/after-apples-rise-a-bruising-fall.html" target="_blank">turned on its former darling</a> as Apple's share price continues to slide, a total decline of 44% since September 2012. This story seems to be as much about a shift in sentiment toward Apple as the numbers themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple remains enormously profitable and the envy of corporations worldwide. And yet Apple’s decline in the stock market has been so swift and so brutal that the development has begun to change the way investors view the company. Apple no longer looks like a sure thing.

<p>Apple looks cheap by the most popular way of gauging a stock’s value, the amount of profit it generates for each outstanding share. Investors are willing to pay about $15 for a dollar of profit of the average Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 company. But for Apple, they will pay less than $9. At its current price, investors are betting that Apple will grow more slowly than the average American company. </p></blockquote></p>

<p>Apple announces its Q2 results next week and earnings are widely expected to be lower than previous quarters. Motley Fool lists <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/18/4-things-that-can-go-wrong-for-apple-next-week.aspx" target="_blank">4 things which may go wrong for the company</a>, including lower earnings, a drop in revenue growth, and no rise in dividends, which would indicate that Apple is hoarding its dormant cash.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bearish case against Apple revolves largely around deteriorating margins, so even worrywarts may not realize that analysts now see Apple's top line growing in the single digits this quarter. Wall Street's eyeing just 8.9% in revenue growth to $42.68 billion. A miss here would probably be even more catastrophic than a sharper decline in profitability. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://business.time.com/2013/04/18/how-far-can-the-mighty-apple-fall/" target="_blank"><em>Time</em> magazine also weighed in</a>, suggesting that while Apple raked in 69% of the profits of the entire smartphone industry last year, it still needs a new product to counter its competition.</p>

<blockquote><p>Few believe Apple can maintain an edge based solely on the strength of incremental improvement to the iPhone and the iPad. Instead, many investors feel, the company needs new breakthrough products of the kind Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs delivered repeatedly during his remarkable career.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Chinese "app store" lets Chinese Apple fans download pirated apps. </strong>Chinese site 7659.com has turned Apple’s own bulk enterprise licensing technology against it to make pirated apps available for free. You don't even need to jailbreak to use them. VentureBeat <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/18/chinese-app-store-using-apples-own-enterprise-app-distribution-tech-to-distribute-pirated-apps/" target="_blank">takes a closer look</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The site, which is only available within China unless you spoof your location via a proxy server, offers a wide selection of iPhone and iPad apps. In just a few moments, I found Final Fantasy V, a $16 iPad game; Badland, a newish $4 app; Le Vamp, a $2 game for iPhone and iPad, and many others. </p></blockquote>

<p>The rather inventive justification of the company behind the site, Kuaiyong, is that many Chinese Apple users find it difficult to manage iTunes.</p>

<blockquote><p>In order for Chinese Apple fans to download applications securely, Kuaiyong developed its own method of giving users access to thousands of free apps without having to jailbreak their devices.

<p>Our goal has always been about bringing Chinese Apple users with quick, convenient and pleasant IOS experience. Since the introduce of Kuaiyong, the proportion of jailbreak in China has declined dramatically from 60% to around 30%.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The problem for Apple of course, is that it is not earning any revenue from the pleasant iOS experience of all those Chinese users.</p>

<p><strong>Apple core rot. </strong>Software engineer, photographer, and former Mac-fan Lloyd L. Chambers' <a href="http://macperformanceguide.com//AppleCoreRot-intro.html" target="_blank">blistering attack</a> on Apple is a few months old but still worth a look. Chambers contends that OS X is no longer a platform fit for serious work. He laments the decline of the core operating system quality, the lack of updates in hardware for professional use, the arbitrary removal of APIs, and Apple's less than benign dictatorship of design and content.</p>

<blockquote><p>OS X is degrading into a base for an entertainment platform. As it stands, the trend is entirely downhill for serious work (albeit a mild grade so far, but steadily downhill nonetheless).

<p>Core operating system quality is declining as resources are diverted to software development in more profitable lines: iPhone, iPad, iHaveNoRealWorkToDo products. Apple forgets its history and leaves it core professional base twisting in the wind.<br />
</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Not everyone agreed with Chambers, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5134022" target="_blank">commenters at Hacker News</a> describing the post as containing "misinformation and half-truths" (commenter Osmium) or even insisting that the trend is in the opposite direction: "I see more and more developers switching to Mac and taking it seriously. My last office switched completely from Ubuntu to Mac" (commenter logn).</p>

<p>However, commenter Vonguard had the following to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple clearly has no desire to keep any users that don't see their iMac as a giant iPhone. The Mac OS was always for casuals, but when they added Unix, it changed and both casual and hardcore could love the same OS. But clearly the hardcore are no longer of any interest to Apple. It's a real shame because the Mac OS was very stable and useable for many years. Now, it's just a toy.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What's gone wrong at Apple?</strong> According to industry observer Paul Kedrosky, the design team led by Jony Ives (just listed as one of <em>Time</em> magazine's  <a href="http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/04/apples-jony-ive-among-time-magazines-100-most-influential-people-list/" target="_blank">100 most influential people in the world</a>), has too much power within the company.</p>

<blockquote><p>When Jobs was alive, Kedrosky implies, this "tension" between the design teams and manufacturing teams was in almost perfect balance. Jobs's brilliance as both a product designer and business executive kept the company from "over-designing" its products, or, just as bad, focusing so much on the numbers that its design standards sagged.

<p>But now that Jobs is gone, Kedrosky suggests, Jony Ive's design team has been given too much power--without a critical check and balance on whether Ive's products can actually be produced in the quantity and timeframe that Apple needs to produce them to meet demand.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Has the dominance of design gone too far? And if it has, what does this mean for other hardware manufacturers?</p>

<p><strong>Hackintosh for creatives. </strong>The <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/" target="_blank">first Hackintosh guide was written specifically for video editors</a> and other creatives to building a machine that’s faster than the entry-level Mabook Pro, for half the price.</p>

<p>The post's author, filmmaker Ryan Koo, insists that creativity shouldn't be restricted to those who can pay for a high-end Mac.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many creative pursuits require the latest technology--especially working with video, which requires a lot of processing power and storage space. But when Apple recently announced new Mac Pros for the first time in almost two years, I wondered why they were so expensive, concluding that they were “not a good value proposition.” As far as video editors were concerned, I also wondered why they no longer offered nVidia graphics cards as an option, despite (or because of) the fact that Adobe Creative Suite uses nVidia cards to get drastically higher performance when editing video.</p></blockquote>
