<p>Apple, the trendsetter, the tastemaker, the unstoppable hit machine, and for a time the world's most valuable company; though still wildly profitable, the empire that Steve built is facing threats from all sides. Are there plans for a counterattack, and will they be sufficient for Apple to continue its reign? This story will track the tech industry's money-minting poster child in a post-Jobs world.</p>

<p><strong>Wall Street turns on Apple.</strong> The <em>New York Times</em> documents how Wall Street has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/technology/after-apples-rise-a-bruising-fall.html" target="_blank">turned on its former darling</a> as Apple's share price continues to slide, a total decline of 44% (or since September 2012. This story seems to be as much about a shift in sentiment towards Apple as the numbers themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple remains enormously profitable and the envy of corporations worldwide. And yet Apple’s decline in the stock market has been so swift and so brutal that the development has begun to change the way investors view the company. Apple no longer looks like a sure thing.

<p>Apple looks cheap by the most popular way of gauging a stock’s value, the amount of profit it generates for each outstanding share. Investors are willing to pay about $15 for a dollar of profit of the average Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 company. But for Apple, they will pay less than $9. At its current price, investors are betting that Apple will grow more slowly than the average American company. </p></blockquote></p>

<p>Apple announces its Q2 results next week and earnings are widely expected to be lower than previous quarters. Motley Fool lists <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/18/4-things-that-can-go-wrong-for-apple-next-week.aspx" target="_blank">4 things which may go wrong for the company</a> including lower earnings, a drop in revenue growth and no rise in dividends which would indicate that Apple is hoarding its dormant cash.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bearish case against Apple revolves largely around deteriorating margins, so even worrywarts may not realize that analysts now see Apple's top line growing in the single digits this quarter. Wall Street's eyeing just 8.9% in revenue growth to $42.68 billion. A miss here would probably be even more catastrophic than a sharper decline in profitability. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://business.time.com/2013/04/18/how-far-can-the-mighty-apple-fall/" target="_blank">Time magazine also weighed in</a>, suggesting that while Apple raked in 69% of the profits of the entire smartphone industry last year, it still needs a new product to counter its competition.</p>

<blockquote><p>Few believe Apple can maintain an edge based solely on the strength of incremental improvement to the iPhone and the iPad. Instead, many investors feel, the company needs new breakthrough products of the kind Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs delivered repeatedly during his remarkable career.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Chinese "app store" lets Chinese Apple fans download pirated apps. </strong>Chinese site 7659.com has turned Apple’s own bulk enterprise licensing technology against it to make pirated apps available for free. You don't even need to jailbreak to use them. VentureBeat <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/18/chinese-app-store-using-apples-own-enterprise-app-distribution-tech-to-distribute-pirated-apps/" target="_blank">takes a closer look</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The site, which is only available within China unless you spoof your location via a proxy server, offers a wide selection of iPhone and iPad apps. In just a few moments, I found Final Fantasy V, a $16 iPad game; Badland, a newish $4 app; Le Vamp, a $2 game for iPhone and iPad, and many others. </p></blockquote>

<p>The rather inventive justification of the company behind the site,  Kuaiyong, is that many Chinese Apple users find it difficult to manage iTunes.</p>

<blockquote><p>In order for Chinese Apple fans to download applications securely, Kuaiyong developed its own method of giving users access to thousands of free apps without having to jailbreak their devices.

<p>Our goal has always been about bringing Chinese Apple users with quick, convenient and pleasant IOS experience. Since the introduce of Kuaiyong, the proportion of jailbreak in China has declined dramatically from 60% to around 30%.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The problem for Apple of course, is that it is not earning any revenue from the pleasant iOS experience of all those Chinese users.</p>

<p><strong>Apple core rot. </strong>Software engineer, photographer and former Mac-fan Lloyd L. Chambers <a href="http://macperformanceguide.com//AppleCoreRot-intro.html" target="_blank">blistering attack</a> on Apple is a few months old but still worth a look. Chambers contends that OS X is no longer a platform fit for serious work. He laments the decline of the core operating system quality, the lack of updates in hardware for professional use, the arbitrary removal of APIs and Apple's less than benign dictatorship of design and content.</p>

<blockquote><p>OS X is degrading into a base for an entertainment platform. As it stands, the trend is entirely downhill for serious work (albeit a mild grade so far, but steadily downhill nonetheless).

<p>Core operating system quality is declining as resources are diverted to software development in more profitable lines: iPhone, iPad, iHaveNoRealWorkToDo products. Apple forgets its history and leaves it core professional base twisting in the wind.<br />
</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Not everyone agreed with Chambers with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5134022" target="_blank">commenters at Hacker News</a> describing the post as containing "misinformation and half-truths" (commenter Osmium) or even insisting that the trend is in the opposite direction "I see more and more developers switching to Mac and taking it seriously. My last office switched completely from Ubuntu to Mac" (commenter logn).</p>

<p>However commenter Vonguard had the following to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple clearly has no desire to keep any users that don't see their iMac as a giant iPhone. The Mac OS was always for casuals, but when they added Unix, it changed and both casual and hardcore could love the same OS. But clearly the hardcore are no longer of any interest to Apple. It's a real shame because the Mac OS was very stable and useable for many years. Now, it's just a toy.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What's gone wrong at Apple?</strong> According to industry observer Paul Kedrosky, the design team led by Jony Ives (just listed as one of Time Magazine's  <a href="http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/04/apples-jony-ive-among-time-magazines-100-most-influential-people-list/" target="_blank">100 most influential people in the world</a>), has too much power within the company.</p>

<blockquote><p>When Jobs was alive, Kedrosky implies, this "tension" between the design teams and manufacturing teams was in almost perfect balance. Jobs's brilliance as both a product designer and business executive kept the company from "over-designing" its products, or, just as bad, focusing so much on the numbers that its design standards sagged.

<p>But now that Jobs is gone, Kedrosky suggests, Jony Ive's design team has been given too much power--without a critical check and balance on whether Ive's products can actually be produced in the quantity and timeframe that Apple needs to produce them to meet demand.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Has the dominance of design gone too far? And if it has, what does this mean for other hardware manufacturers?</p>

<p><strong>Hackintosh for creatives. </strong>The <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/build-a-hackintosh/" target="_blank">first Hackintosh guide written specifically for video editors</a> and other creatives to building a machine that’s faster than the entry-level Mabook Pro, for half the price.</p>

<p>The post's author film maker Ryan Koo insists that creativity shouldn't be restricted those who can pay for a high-end Mac.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many creative pursuits require the latest technology — especially working with video, which requires a lot of processing power and storage space. But when Apple recently announced new Mac Pros for the first time in almost two years, I wondered why they were so expensive, concluding that they were “not a good value proposition.” As far as video editors were concerned, I also wondered why they no longer offered nVidia graphics cards as an option, despite (or because of) the fact that Adobe Creative Suite uses nVidia cards to get drastically higher performance when editing video.</p></blockquote>
