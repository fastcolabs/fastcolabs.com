<p>Cumulatively, Apple devices are on track to outsell Microsoft PCs this year, according to a <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2014/01/13/when-apple-reached-parity-with-windows/" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> from Asymco founder Horace Dediu. Dediu didn't include phone or tablet sales in Microsoft's tally, but we imagine those numbers aren't, ahem, statistically significant.</p>

<p>2004 was the year Microsoft <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/04/the-building-and-dismantling-of-the-windows-advantage/" target="_blank">peaked</a> and things begin to change. The consumer market started beating out the enterprise market, and device mobility became important to consumers. Apple had the <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/11/19/why-the-mac-keeps-growing/" target="_blank">better</a> laptop option; soon after, they released a newfangled music playing device called the iPod. Those people liked their experiences--the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/14/total-apple-device-sales-will-equal-windows-pcs-this-year-predicts-analyst/" target="_blank">barrier to entry</a> of Apple products was obliterated, so consumers decided to stick with Apple. Eventually, Apple released the iPhone, an even more pertinent game changer for the mobile phone market and reported a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/31/android-captures-record-81-global-market-share-windows-phone-is-fastest-growing/" target="_blank">13.5%</a> market share in 2013. Window's Phones only outsold iPhones in <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/windows-phone-devices-outselling-apples-iphone-in-24-markets-microsoft-468119" target="_blank">24 markets</a>, and held a 4.1% market share. (Both lost miserably to Android phones.)</p>

<p>Apple has been dominating the tablet market, and it's rumored that the company will be unveiling a 12- or 13-inch <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/01/08/apple-and-samsungs-new-devices-could-destroy-the-d/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>, targeted at businesses. Microsoft's Surface's struggle to take off lead to a $900 million "inventory adjustment." But, honestly, who wants to buy a device with barely 100,000 apps when there's <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-900-million-surface-rt-write-down-how-did-this-happen-7000018275/" target="_blank">10 times</a> that amount for iOS devices, 475,000 native iPad apps alone?</p>

<p>Microsoft's been clinging onto hope as Office remains the most popular productivity software. As the nature of work life changes and the need for cloud-based computing increases, web-based software has become more integral. Apple-loyal employees working under <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304244904579278560822979176" target="_blank">Bring Your Own Device</a> pretenses are merging the consumer and enterprise markets, the latter the only place where Microsoft could claim a kingdom.</p>

<p>Tim Cook is looking to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304244904579278560822979176" target="_blank">change</a> that by making corporate email systems more easily connectable to and enhancing the data encryption of iPads, which are already popular as point-of-sale machines. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304244904579278560822979176" target="_blank">Ninety percent</a> of all business apps were released on iOS in the third quater of 2013. <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a>, used by many smaller retailers, is only available on iOS and Android devices. Just sayin'.</p>

<p>Apple, already giving away Pages, Keynote, and Numbers for free with new device purchases, announced new, free iOS versions of <a href="http://bit.ly/1d4TyxT" target="_blank">iWork</a>, their own office productivity software, at last year's WWDC, which might have solidified Microsoft's slow <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/12234355/1/pieces-are-in-place-for-microsofts-death.html" target="_blank">death</a>.</p>

<p>Still, a study recently released shows that Microsoft is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57617097-71/microsoft-more-trusted-than-apple-study-says/" target="_blank">a more</a> "trustworthy" brand than Apple, which was allocated "remarkable" and "unmistakable," perceived as being <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/study-microsoft-outpaces-apple-battle-mindshare/" target="_blank">riskier</a>.</p>

<p>If Dediu's analysis is correct, and Apple really is unprecedentedly closing the gap between two traditionally segmented markets, it'll be a new <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304244904579278560822979176" target="_blank">challenge</a> with which other companies have not really been successful coping.</p>
