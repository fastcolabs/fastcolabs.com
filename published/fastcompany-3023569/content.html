<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/95342015/360o-for-gopro-dslr-video-and-compact-cameras-ocul" target="_blank">Eye Mirror</a> is trying to attack affordability and compatibility for its lenses with a new <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/95342015/360o-for-gopro-dslr-video-and-compact-cameras-ocul" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign. The most appealing aspect is being able to attach an Eye Mirror lens to a new GoPro and take 360-degree video. The lenses are also able to attach to compact point-and-shoot cameras as well as DSLRs. The 360 degree lenses start at $195 for the early-bird Kickstarter price and go up slightly beyond that.</p>

<p>In addition to the hardware, Eye Mirror provides advances on the software side, being able to easily edit the 360-degree video with any industry program and convert the point of view using drag-and-drop software. The company also has what it calls a “YouTube like” site to which you can upload your 360-degree video and allow anyone to interact with it.</p>

<p>Another product in the 360-degree space is <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/panono-panoramic-ball-camera" target="_blank">Panono’s panoramic ball camera</a>, which is currently in the middle of its own crowdfunding campaign. The camera ball was originally shown off in 2011 as a concept, but is now on the cusp of becoming a reality. It takes on a completely different approach from Eye Mirror’s lenses, but still manages to bring the effect to the consumer level. Throwing the camera ball in the air produces an amazing, interactive <a href="http://demo.panono.com/view/326/VZS4UVHG5W/" target="_blank">photograph of your surroundings</a>. The ball is available during its campaign for $499 and afterwards for $599.</p>

<p>Oculus Rift has been an integral part of the 360-degree movement--originally designed for virtual reality gaming--and both Eye Mirror and Panono are compatible with the head-mounted display.</p>

<p>Simplifying the concept even further, BubblePix <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1218595273/bubblepod-professional-360o-images-in-less-than-a-0" target="_blank">successfully funded its BubblePod</a>, an add-on designed to bring the 360-degree experience to phones. Steadier and more complete than a panorama image, the BubblePod spins a phone around and with the company’s app provides an interactive image. At about $40, the BubblePod is aimed at a slightly different audience than both the Panono or Eye Mirror, but expands on the promise of interactive 360-degree images.</p>
