<p>In October 2012 the Parallella project ended its <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign, having easily surpassed its funding goal of $750,000. Unlike many Kickstarter hardware projects which you may consider lighthearted, Parallella has a rather astonishing goal: It's all about creating a credit card-sized computer that has a complex enough architecture that it can push out up to 90 gigaflops. Which makes it, more or less, a palmtop <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672444/try-a-recipe-devised-by-ibms-supercomputer-chef" target="_self">supercomputer</a>. And to go with its diminutive size, the Parallella has a diminutive price--going for just $99 in its entry level edition.</p>

<p>As part of the Kickstarter project, the team behind the hardware promised that they'd release the device's design as open source. And this <a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2013/06/30/99-parallella-supercomputer-is-now-open-source-hardware/" target="_blank">they've now done</a>--lending some realistic backbone to the Kickstarter promise of making a "supercomputer for everyone."</p>

<p>Packing an ARM Cortex A9 chip alongside either a 16-core or 64-core Ephiphany multicore coprocessor, the Parallela's design also includes 1 GB of DDR3 memory, some basic on-board LEDs, USB ports, an Ethernet connector and microHDMI out. It's also USB powered, and this along with its 87 by 53 mm size may remind you of an Arduino.</p>

<p>But with the 64-core edition pushing out 90 gigaflops of <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1714174/1000-core-cpu-achieved-your-future-desktop-will-be-supercomputer" target="_self">parallel processing</a> power, it easily surpasses the slow processing of an Arduino. 90GFlops is roughly equivalent to the kind of machine that would have appeared in the famous <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002989/us-takes-back-world-supercomputer-crown-two-fastest-machines" target="_self">Top 500</a> list of <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BFastCompany/posts/TK4QLVqdzKw" target="_blank">supercomputers</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer#Performance_metrics" target="_blank">early 1990s</a>. Machines on this list typically cost many millions, and sometimes billions of dollars.</p>

<p>The Parallella team imagines that innovative coders will be able to make the device perform some incredible imaging, communications, audio or even medical applications, and do so at a significantly lower price than through other options. It's just a question of building the machine, loading Linux onto it and getting coding.</p>
