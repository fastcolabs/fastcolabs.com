<p>If you’re on this list, congratulations! We’ll be in touch in the next 24 hours to get your $10,000 check on its way, discuss your Target mentorship for the next phase, and to pick your brain about how you came up with your idea (and where you’ll take it in the prototype phase).</p>

<h5><a name="What_Happens_Next">What Happens Next?</a></h5>

<p>This week, we’ll highlight each of these finalists in depth with their own well-deserved analysis, and we’ll also write about some outstanding and unique runners-up. Thanks to all who put the time and energy into their submissions. We’re fortunate to have some of the smartest technology and design readers out there, and competition was fierce. Stay tuned for future Co.Labs accelerators and hackathons!</p>
