<p>"Hollywood is a place that creates a viewer escape. What I try to do, as a director, I…," said a visibly nervous director-slash-producer Michael Bay at Samsung's press conference yesterday afternoon before conceding to a teleprompter mishap and excusing himself from the stage.</p>

<p>"The type is all off. Sorry. But, I'll just wing this."</p>

<p>"Tell us what you think," said the other co-host on stage.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I'll just wing it," Bay said, not sound confident, taking a deep breath before trying to eke out a genuine answer for <em>why he directs in the first place</em>. "I try to take people on an emotional ride." After that, the overwhelmed Bay could hardly focus on what he was there to do--talk about Samsung's curved <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/samsung-unveils-entire-uhd-tv-lineup-ces-2014-leading-110-inch-monster/" target="_blank">Ultra High Definition Television</a>--and so he left the stage.</p>

<p>Not long after, Bay took to his blog to flesh out what had happened.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wow! I just embarrassed myself at CES – I was about to speak for Samsung for this awesome Curved 105-inch UHD TV. I rarely lend my name to any products, but this one is just stellar. I got so excited to talk, that I skipped over the Exec VP's intro line and then the teleprompter got lost. Then the prompter went up and down – then I walked off. I guess live shows aren't my thing.<br />
But I'm doing a special curved screen experience with Samsung and Transformers 4 footage that will be traveling around the world.<br />
Michael</p></blockquote>

<p>"Excited," huh. I wasn't aware inanimate objects, such as teleprompters, could err so odiously and "get lost" -- very cool that even unexpected machines possess the AI to make human mistakes. And how about that Ultra HD TV? It's curved!</p>

<p>Speaking on stage is one of the hardest things any executive has to do. How do you recover? What's the secret for keeping your cool when things go off-script?</p>

<p>Programmer Jakub Chodounsky <a href="http://chodounsky.net/2013/07/17/introduction-to-public-speaking/" target="_blank">writes</a> that spontaneity and adaptability is crucial in these situations. And you probably shouldn't be working off of a memorized script anyway, <a href="http://danshipper.com/public-speaking-for-introverts" target="_blank">says Dan Shipper</a>, founder of <a href="http://usefirefly.com/" target="_blank">Firefly</a>. Instead, practice talking about the key points--you'll come off as an authentic and relatable person, and if things go awry, you'll be well-prepared and able to riff off what your consort or PowerPoint slide says. As startup CEO Josh Kerr notes <a href="https://joshkerr.com/some-great-demo-day-pitch-tips/" target="_blank">on his blog</a>, "There is no such thing as winging it. Even a 60 second pitch requires a ton of preparation."</p>

<p>Developer Matt Gemmel has some more specific advice--first and foremost, If you must be rehearsed on stage, then rehearse. We'll paraphrase the list here; click here to see his <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/public-speaking/" target="_blank">other tips</a>.<br />
<ol>
  <li><span>Rehearse fully so nerves don't distract you.</span></li>
  <li><span>Make eye contact with people around the audience.</span></li>
  <li><span>Don’t do demos unless you are sure they'll work. </span></li>
  <li><span>Don’t write code or debug during a presentation. </span></li>
  <li><span>Don’t just serve up slides loaded with bullet points; add some variety.</span></li>
  <li><span>Make yourself comfortable, physically; adopt a powerful pose and project your voice.</span></li>
  <li><span>Be dynamic and energetic.</span></li>
  <li><span>Remember that in almost all presentations, you’re telling a story, not conveying data.</span></li>
  <li><span>Don't be careless--mind the details and anticipate questions.</span></li>
  <li><span>Be funny and human--you're not here to act like a square.</span></li>
  <li><span>Take a break if the presentation is long--people need a recess to stay attentive.</span></li>
  <li><span>Watch yourself speak during rehearsal by recording video.</span></li>
  <li><span>Relax beforehand, and consider your physical needs. </span></li>
  <li><span>When you walk on stage, break the tension by talking loudly, saying good morning, or inviting the crowd to participate in an ice breaker.</span></li>
</ol></p>

<p>And, for the sake of everyone's second-hand embarrassment, stay calm. If you stumble on an "um" or other subconsciously injected speech disfluency, <a href="http://humbledmba.com/public-speaking-for-normal-people" target="_blank">embrace it</a>, writes Jason Freedman, co-founder of <a href="http://42floors.com/" target="_blank">42Floors</a>. Focus by acting like you're speaking to one or two people in the room. Find your ritualistic pose of confidence.</p>

<p>Oh, Michael. Poor Michael. It is clear now that live shows are indeed "not your thing." Better to stick to those "emotional rides," also known as... stuff exploding.</p>
